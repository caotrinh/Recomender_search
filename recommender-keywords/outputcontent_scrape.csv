       Employers One of the key drivers for UOWx is to help students increase their employability. In the process of creating UOWx, we sat down with over 25 employers from a range of industries and posed the question, ‘If everyone has a degree, how do you choose who gets the job?’ They all pointed to the skills and experience students had gained outside of the classroom. Each employer highlighted the importance of soft skills that are gained through work experience and volunteer opportunities.  When a student graduates from UOW they will have their co-curricular activities listed on their UOWx Record. Students who have made a significant contribution to their learning will graduate with the UOWx Award.  Want to get involved?Register your interest here!  Why choose UOWx graduates? UOWx graduates have met rigorous criteria around various learning streams, all of which were identified by employers as being necessary skills in today’s workplace. Each recognised co-curricular activity provides students with the opportunity to develop in a minimum number of skill areas, including:Improve a student's organisational skills;Contribute positively to learning of self or others;Develops effective communication and interpersonal skills; Demonstrates intercultural awareness; Develops a student's problem solving skills; and Develops reflective thinking skills to evaluate and articulate their impact and personal development.   How can employers get involved in the UOWx initiative?There are a number of ways employers can get involved with the UOWx program:Become a mentorStudents who are participating in the UOWx Award Program who we have identified as being extraordinary. *Provide more info about opportunity and then link to the UOW Mentoring section* or email us at UOWx. Become a UOWx Seminar or Workshop PresenterUOWx runs 5 workshops a year which allow students to develop skills in a key employability/niche on trend area UOWx are always on the hunt for passionate and enthuastic presenters with industry experiences.

Moodle - Learning Co-Op @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/learningcoop/software/moodle/index.html,"


Moodle

This resource will provide an overview of Moodle. We will explain how to access Moodle, how to access course materials and how to upload assessments. 


What is Moodle?
Moodle is a learning management system that is used by the university to host course materials, to submit or complete assessments, and to participate in discussions.
When you study at the university, you will be able to access Moodle sites for each of your subjects and for some extracurricular activities. 
 
What do you use Moodle for?
You can use Moodle to access important documents (like subject outlines, assessment rubrics, lecture slides and recordings), to submit assessments, to complete assessments like quizzes, to check your grades for assessments and to participate in discussion forums. 


Accessing Moodle Moodle can be accessed via SOLS after you have logged in, by clicking on the ‘eLearning’ tab.  After you have clicked on the ‘eLearning’ tab, you will be navigated to your Moodle homepage (see image below). In the Site Summary section, you will find a list of sites, including those for each subject you are studying this semester. 


Using Moodle    Accessing course materials To access course materials, like lecture slides or subject outlines, locate them in the Moodle site by looking for links that appear in a blue font. Click on the link and the materials will either automatically download or open in a new tab for you. NOTE: Each subject coordinator can set up their subject’s Moodle site in a variety of formats, which means that course materials may appear anywhere in the site. If you can’t find them, contact your subject coordinator.      Uploading an assessment To upload an assignment to Moodle, locate the submission link in the subject’s Moodle site.. The link will appear next to a hand symbol.   		Click on the ‘Add submission’ button at the bottom of the page, and click on the ‘Add...’ button. Follow the prompts to select and add your assessment. When you have added your assessment, check the box that confirms the submission is your own work, and click on the blue ‘Save changes’ button. You will receive a digital receipt via UOWmail notifying you that your assessment has been submitted. This process may be slightly different on different Moodle sites. It is always best to give yourself some leeway with uploading assignments to ensure that if you experience any problems, you have plenty of time to seek help from your Subject Coordinator. NOTE: If you experience difficulty uploading your file, it may be that it is too big. An easy fix is to save it as a PDF and to submit the PDF version.    Using a discussion forum   A Moodle discussion forum is an online communication system the lecturer can organise for the students in the subject to collaborate and engage in discussion regarding set topics by the lecturer. As a user, you are able to read and post messages that can be seen by the whole cohort of students enrolled in the subject. If the lecturer has organised a discussion forum for the subject, the ‘dialogue’   symbol will appear under the subject name to inform you that there is a discussion forum for this subject to which you can contribute.   Closing date of Moodle subjects   Each subject you have enrolled in for the semester will have a closing date, after which you will no longer have access to the subject Moodle site. The closing date information can be located in your SOLS account under the tab Current Session > eLearning Details. This will display information such as the session, subject code and name, site name, and available from/to dates. To prevent disappointment when the subject is no longer in your ‘Site summary’ section in Moodle, it is best practice to save all the lecture notes and any additional information that may be relevant to you before the closing date.   The Moodle Student Dashboard The Moodle Student Dashboard will display feedback on your activity and results for a particular Moodle site. The dashboard will appear at the top of a Moodle page unless the Subject Coordinator has hidden it from view. Click on ‘Show progress’ to view the feedback. To learn more about the Moodle Student Dashboard, take a look at the ‘Moodle Student Dashboard – Information for Students’ page.

Assessment Feedback - Learning Co-Op @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/learningcoop/assessments/UOW244730.html,"


Understanding Assessment Feedback This resource explains feedback and overviews how to use feedback to improve your learning. 


What Is Feedback? Feedback refers to the constructive evaluation comments on an assessment task. Feedback is a powerful tool that can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses, direct your attention to areas that require improvement, improve your quality of learning, and develop interpersonal skills, such as communication and critical analysis. Types of feedback you may receive at UOW include:  Verbal feedback: Feedback is given verbally by teacher or peers       Written feedback: Feedback that is given in writing alongside with your marks after your teacher has evaluated your work. This may either be in the form of written comments or scaled on an assessment rubric.       Marks or grades: You will receive a mark for individual assessment tasks and an overall mark for each subject – this is a form of feedback too.    Where can I find my feedback?  When you receive marks for assessment tasks, you usually will receive written feedback. If it is a hard-copy assignment, generally your feedback will be written by hand by the marker throughout the document. They may also use the marking rubric to indicate how well you’ve performed in each area. If it is a digital assignment submitted through Moodle, your tutor or Subject Coordinator may upload a document containing your feedback, or a copy of your assignment with the feedback written at the end. If you can’t find your feedback, contact your Subject Coordinator or tutor. They may also choose to provide it verbally to you. 


Understanding and Using Feedback  To get the most out of feedback, you should:  Approach feedback with a positive mind. Receiving feedback can be hard, especially if you feel you haven’t done well. Try to remember that feedback is a tool for you to improve your learning.       Don’t just focus on the negatives. It can be easy to overlook positive feedback in favour for focusing on the negatives. Positive feedback is just as useful as negative, so make sure you use it to your advantage.       Critically reflect on the feedback you receive. Ask yourself if you agree with the feedback. Take a look at your assessment and try to understand what the marker is saying. How could you have done better? Did you prepare enough before the assessment? Where are your strengths and weaknesses? What did the marker identify that you did well?       Identify what you have done well, and what area(s) needed improvement. Think about how you can use it to improve for your next assessment task.       Ask for clarification from your Subject Coordinator or peers. If you aren’t sure what you need to improve on, or if you don’t agree with the feedback, talk to your tutor or Subject Coordinator. It may also be useful to reflect on your feedback with your peers.       Document the feedback you receive. Feedback is a way for you to improve in the future – you don’t want to forget it! Keep track of the feedback you receive in a word document that you can return to when completing your next assessment task.       


Giving Feedback While at university, you will be asked formally (i.e., as a part of an assessment task) or informally (i.e., by your peers or friends) to give feedback on others’ works. Giving effective and constructive feedback can be challenging and sometimes uncomfortable. Our Peer-Assessment and Self-Evaluation resource outlines useful ways to frame and deliver feedback to your peers.",,"['generally', 'rubric', 'powerful', 'provide', 'frame', 'work', 'individual', 'future', 'works', 'skills', 'digital', 'teacher', 'understand', 'improve', 'return', 'direct', 'forget', 'outlines', 'scaled', 'giving', 'overviews', 'choose', 'uncomfortable', 'hand', 'negatives', 'focusing', 'needed', 'assignment', 'tasks', 'aren', 'develop', 'writing', 'identify', 'performed', 'part', 'moodle', 'find', 'attention', 'overlook', 'critical', 'receive', 'end', 'receiving', 'verbally', 'form', 'formally', 'talk', 'uow', 'feel', 'track', 'asked', 'hard-copy', 'challenging', 'make', 'self-evaluation', 'copy', 'prepare', 'friends', 'require', 'mind', 'peers', 'peer-assessment', 'refers', 'marker', 'alongside', 'upload', 'grades', 'easy', 'quality', 'marks', 'ways', 'understanding', 'hard', 'deliver', 'area', 'favour', 'critically', 'constructive', 'don', 'learning', 'advantage', 'types', 'remember', 'positive', 'reflect', 'agree', 'include', 'approach', 'effective', 'marking', 'subject', 'submitted', 'university', 'clarification', 'tool', 'verbal', 'weaknesses', 'evaluation', 'coordinator', 'mark', 'give', 'evaluated', 'areas', 'improvement', 'word', 'feedback', 'task', 'interpersonal', 'resource', 'completing', 'communication', 'informally', 'document', 'assessment', 'negative', 'strengths', 'explains', 'haven', 'contact', 'tutor', 'analysis', 'written', 've', 'comments', 'focus']"
Effective Headings - Learning Co-Op @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/learningcoop/assessments/effectiveheadings/index.html,"


Effective Headings

This resource will introduce the use of headings in academic writing, including how to use headings correctly and what value they add to your writing.


What are headings?

Headings are signposts that help you structure longer pieces of writing and allow the reader easily navigate their way around a document. The type of headings used will depend on the format of your writing: for example, a case study will have different headings to a report. Make sure that:


	the heading system is clear and logical
	the sub-headings all have the same font style at that particular level
	the wording of the headings and sub-headings is alike.


It is best to take a couple of minutes to work out a plan for your headings before you start.



Components of an effective heading
Graded levels
It is common for headings to be graded at levels to communicate a logical structure. Usually it is advisable to use a maximum of three levels, depending on the length of the document. Don’t forget that the aim of using headings is to make it easy for the reader to easily find their way around a written document – using too many headings and levels can create confusion.
Levels are created with the use of font type, font size, position, capital letters, boldface and underlining. You can follow a given pattern or make up your own system so long as it is consistent.
Example
Level 1: CAPITALS, bold, 14pt, centered, space below

Level 2: Lowercase, bold, 12pt, left justified, space below

Level 3: Lowercase, italics, 12pt, left justified, no space below
 
The headings used in this resource are a good example of levelling without the use of numbers; however, in longer documents such as reports or theses, numbering is extremely important to assist the reader in keeping track of what section of the document they are reading.
 
Information distributed into logical sections
Headings should be used to identify a section; they are not to be used for each paragraph. Your analysis of the question will be key to working out your sections and headings.
Example
Question: what are the competitive drivers involved in a differentiation strategy?
1. COMPETITIVE DRIVERS 
         	1.1 Differentiation strategy and current operations
         	Definition of a differentiation strategy
         	Describe the difference of the theory in the previous heading to what is happening in your industry/business
         	1.2. New strategies
         	Provide the marker with what your group deems a profitable strategy
         	1.3. Justification
         	Provide reasons for this new strategy and offer evidence of your decision
 
Linked with the text
You should try to introduce the topic of your heading in the first paragraph following your heading. This will announce to the reader what will be coming up in that section. Remember that a heading does not speak for itself: the text following a heading should always restate and reinforce the main idea of that section, as in the example below.
Example

Reward and recognition of teaching
    The reward and recognition of teaching has been a national focus in Australian higher education since…

 
Grammar
Headings are usually single words or short phrases without a full stop. The wording, style and punctuation need to be consistent when designing a heading system, especially the use of capital letters. This can be achieved by following these three rules:

ensure all headings are brief
ensure the wording of the heading is specific to the text that follows
follow a parallel structure (editex 2016)

Example
To follow a parallel structure, you need to follow a grammatically consistent pattern for each heading level throughout the document.




Using ‘ing’ phrasing for headings
Using noun phrases for headings




Defining teaching standards
Determining criteria
Proposing a framework




Definitions of teaching standards
Criteria for judging teaching standards
Proposal for a framework






 
EXAMPLE
With capitalization, you have a choice of maximal or minimal capitalization.

With maximal capitalization, all words except articles, prepositions and conjunctions are capitalised.
              Eg. Rivalry among Existing Firms

With minimal capitalization, only the first word of the title and any proper nouns are capitalised.
              Eg. Rivalry among existing firms



When using headings do not:

	use too many headings
	change the style of headings within a document
	number the headings unless asked, e.g. numbering is likely to be needed in a long report but not a short document
	leave a heading at the bottom of the page by itself
	stack headings (no text between them)
	write headings more than one line long
	use definite articles to begin headings (e.g. âA Function of Business Xâ should be âFunction of Business Xâ)

Cover Sheets This resource describes cover sheets and explains the process of locating one for your assessment. 


What Is A Cover Sheet? A cover sheet is a document that contains metadata about your assessment, such as the assessment title, your name and student number, your tutor’s name, and other relevant data. Cover sheets are used to ensure your assessment goes to the right place to be marked, and that the right mark is assigned to you. If you are submitting a hardcopy assessment, you will be required to attach a cover sheet to your assessment before handing it in.   Do I use a PDF cover sheet or a barcode cover sheet? Which cover sheet you are required to use will vary between subjects. Check with your subject coordinator if you are unsure.


Finding The Correct Cover Sheet For Your Assessment   From the Current Students page, click on the Cover Sheets button. Click on your faculty from the list provided.

Turn It In - Learning Co-Op @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/learningcoop/software/turnitin/index.html,"


TurnitinThese resources will provide an overview of Turnitin, It explains how to access Turnitin, how to submit assessments using the software, and how to understand an original report. 


What is Turnitin?Turnitin is an electronic text matching software used by the university to prevent plagiarism.How does Turnitin work?The software compares students’ assessments against a database containing copies of academic publications, assessments submitted by other students, and a slew of Internet content, and produces an originality report that indicates how much of the assessment has been plagiarised.What do you use Turnitin for?When you submit an assessment via Moodle, you may be required to do so through Turnitin. If your subject coordinator has set up the appropriate permissions, you are able to retrieve the originality report for your assessment to check that you have referenced appropriately. In some cases, you can then resubmit your work after improving any errors. 


Submitting your assessment through Turnitin
If you are required to submit your assessment via Turnitin, the Turnitin icon    will appear next to the assessment title.
To submit your assessment, click on the Submit Paper button. In the window that appears, upload your assessment file by clicking on the Add File  button and following the prompts. When you have uploaded your file, type the title of your assessment in the box provided, and click the ‘Add Submission’ button .
Upon uploading your assignment, you will receive a digital receipt to acknowledge that your assignment has successfully been uploaded to Turnitin. Take note of your ‘Turnitin submission id:’ in case you need to refer back to it in the future.


What is an Originality Report?The original report identifies how similar your assessment is to existing works and provides information about the sources that it matches.What can I use the originality report for?You can use your originality report as a guide to help you improve your assignment and academic writing skills. The report provides an overall matching similarity percentage and feedback about your work in terms of: Content: correctly acknowledging someone else’s ideas and writing Punctuation: correct use of punctuation to identify direct quotes that have been properly cited Quality of references: inclusion of recognised authors and well cited papers Format of references: presented in the correct format with all details 


Retrieving an Originality ReportThe first time that you upload your assignment, it will take 10 minutes for Turnitin to generate an originality report. To retrieve the report, click on the assessment link on your subject’s Moodle site, and then click on the similarity score next to your assessment (see image below). 


Navigating an Originality Report
Your original report will open in Turnitin’s document viewer. On the right-hand side, you will see the toolbar pictured below.







Active layers button. When viewing your originality report, you can choose to view it with two layers – grading and similarity. The grading layer will only be available after your assessment has been marked.






Instructor Feedback button. You can use this button to access feedback from your marker.






Match overview button. The number displayed here is your similarity percentage. When you click on this number, the Match Overview will be display. 
All sources button. Clicking on this will show a detailed report on each match, including the source of the matching text Turnitin has identified. 
Filter button. You can use this button to filter the report to exclude quotes, bibliographies, or sources that are a particular length or percentage.







Download button. Click on this button to download a copy of your originality report. 
Submission information button. Clicking on this button will display details on your submission, including the submission ID, submission date and file name.




 


Using Originality Reports      The similarity percentage The similarity percentage indicates how much of your paper matched to similar works. There is no “magic number” percentage that you should aim for. Generally the lower the percentage, the better. A high similarity percentage may be caused by incorrect referencing (i.e., incorrect punctuation in citations) or by text that is too similar to other’s works. To reduce your similarity percentage, double check you’ve applied the appropriate referencing style and try to summarise  or paraphrase your sources. If you are unsure if your percentage is too low or too high, contact your subject coordinator.   Identifying matches When you open your originality report, a match overview will appear. This displays a list of sources that Turnitin thinks may be too similar to your work. When you click on a match in the match overview panel, the software will jump you to the part of your submission that is related to the match, as well as displaying a pop up of the text Turnitin has found in its database that has similarities (see image below).     Resubmitting your assessment In most cases, you are able to resubmit your assessment after viewing the originality report. After correcting any errors, simply resubmit your assessment the same way you did the first time. NOTE: Turnitin will take 24 hours to generate new original report for any resubmissions.    Accessing assessment grades and feedback To view your assessment grades and any feedback provided by the marker, click on the Instructor feedback button. The marker may have also left comments throughout your assessment. To view these comments, ensure the ‘Feedback’ layer is selected using the Active Layers button. You can then scroll through the assessment document to find the comments. Click on the comment icons  to view the comments.   Downloading and printing your originality report  Before printing your originality report, ensure the similarity layer is selected as active by clicking on the Active layers icon  in the main toolbar and checking the box next to ‘Similarity’. Then, click on the Download icon  . This will download the entire document. Your similarity report will appear in the last pages of the document. Print the document as normal through the PDF viewer.

Summarising - Learning Co-Op @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/learningcoop/referencingciting/summarising/index.html,"


SummarisingThis resource will help you recognise the importance of summarising and describe how summarising habits relate to smart studying, ethical conduct and effective communication. 


What is summarising?To summarise is simply to identify the most important information from a text. You are probably summarising every day without thinking about it. A summary is always much shorter than the original text, but there is more to summarising than simply copying some sentences from a source and leaving out others. Summarising is a matter of analysing and re-purposing information.What is to be taken in summary from a text depends on the type of text being summarised and the new purpose to which information is to be put. An argument, for example, would be summarised into a thesis statement and a few key points, leaving out all the explanation and detailed evidence. A research report would be summarised into the motivating problem or driving question, the type of method and the findings of greatest significance, leaving out all the descriptive and explanatory details and raw data (exactly what an abstract does for a journal article). A summary of a case in law would comprise of something like the facts of the case, the decision, the ratio and any significant obiter, including noting dissenting judgements. If you’re not sure on the best way to summarise a type of text that you come across regularly in a subject, try asking your lecturer or tutor for clarification.The introduction to every academic text you read (and write) should provide the reader with a summarising preview of what is to come, rather than discussing the details immediately.Why summarise?Writing a summary is useful because in the act of identifying what is important, you are analysing and evaluating information, and forming memories of what you have read or heard – which is half the job of studying for an exam. Having an accurate and short record of what you’ve read or heard is also a useful source of ‘digested’ information for use when you need to generate a new text that involves re-presenting others’ ideas.


How do I summarise? You can summarise a text in many different ways, depending on which idea or concept from the original text you want to use for your own purposes. In the summaries below, there are several things to notice:   The original text can be shortened a little or a lot. A summary could be a simple selection of key sentences without changing them, but to be most useful as a learning strategy, summarising usually involves identifying the key words of the original text.  The topic of the message can be changed by starting with a different element. Conciseness can be achieved by choosing words that in themselves summarise larger chunks of information.  You still need to reference where you have used another person’s ideas, even if you have summarised it rather than copied it verbatim.  Example Original text (from Spiro 2013) “One of the considerations that is all too often ignored in discussions of tax policy is the way it affects the underground economy. Theoretical tax models almost always assume that everybody follows the rules. In reality, the behavioural response to tax changes has a wider range of variation than the choice between labour and leisure. Many otherwise honest citizens are prepared to break the law in order to evade taxes. Once the underground economy is taken into account – in effect, the proposition that individuals may decide to “opt out” of the tax system – there is a whole new layer of complexity to tax policy. Taxes that may seem to be optimal without the underground economy may no longer be optimal once it is taken into consideration.” Example summaries   Theoretical tax models should not overlook the effect of the underground economy on tax policy. As responses to tax changes vary between individuals, many are ready to commit tax crimes when faced with such changes (Spiro 2013).  Even honest citizens are prepared to evade taxes when faced with changes in tax policy (Spiro 2013).

Paraphrasing - Learning Co-Op @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/learningcoop/referencingciting/paraphrasing/index.html,"


ParaphrasingThis resource introduces paraphrasing as a critical academic practice and provides examples to help you recognise what makes a good and bad paraphrase.


What is a paraphrase? To paraphrase is to ‘reword’ text, so that the information stays the same while other aspects of the communication are changed. From a learning perspective, paraphrasing is really the nuts and bolts of information 'processing', done as part of taking notes or drafting new text. It is the opposite of mindlessly copying information, and plays a central role in developing a personal understanding of something, as well as in avoiding plagiarism. Plagiarism is not only about failing to acknowledge a source of information; it is also about failing to make sense of information in relation to a new purpose and context.Being able to paraphrase well is a challenging and creative part of academic writing. Doing it well demonstrates: you have a sound understanding of the original source you have credibility as an independent intellect you are proficient and flexible in your use of English   In contrast to a summary, which would be far shorter than the original text, a paraphrase might be of the same length, or even longer. What defines a good paraphrase is not its length, but the degree to which the original text has been reworded and referenced effectively and appropriately to accurately convey the original meaning and source in the context of the paraphraser’s argument. Why is paraphrasing difficult? Paraphrasing is often much more difficult than summarising, as paraphrasing requires you to reword the original text while retaining the meaning and relating the information in the context of your writing.If you don't paraphrase well, you might risk altering the meaning of the original text. Example Original text (from Jagtenberg & D’Alton’s Four Dimensional Social Space): The education system has performed, on an even wider scale, a major task of social control, training the growing workforce in the discipline and work style necessary in a capitalist economy, and systematically conveying ‘acceptable’ — i.e. safe — social attitudes to the rising generations.  Note that in this paraphrase the use of ‘the major form of control’ overstates and therefore misrepresents the argument in the original text. According to Jagtenberg and D'Alton (1988), the education system is the major form of control in a capitalist economy.  Also, if your paraphrase is too close to the original, it is considered plagiarised. Example Note that this paraphrase closely follows the structure of the original text and includes many of its phrases, and thus, can be considered plagiarism. According to Jagtenberg and D'Alton (1988), the education system has performed social control in a capitalist society:  training the growing workforce and work style, and teaching 'acceptable' social attitudes  for the young generations.  


How do I paraphrase? While there are a number of techniques you can use to put something into your own words, such as changing the sentence structure and noun phrases and using appropriate synonyms, the most important thing you need to focus on are the key ideas that you wish to convey to support your argument.You can paraphrase a text in many different ways, depending on which idea or concept from the original text you want to use to support your argument. In the examples below, the underlined part is the main idea of each paraphrase. Original (from Spiro's Tax Policy and the Underground Economy) One of the considerations that is all too often ignored in discussions of tax policy is the way it affects the underground economy. Theoretical tax models almost always assume that everybody follows the rules. In reality, the behavioural response to tax changes has a wider range of variation than the choice between labour and leisure. Many otherwise honest citizens are prepared to break the law in order to evade taxes. Once the underground economy is taken into account – in effect, the proposition that individuals may decide to “opt out” of the tax system – there is a whole new layer of complexity to tax policy. Taxes that may seem to be optimal without the underground economy may no longer be optimal once it is taken into consideration.   Examples Note in these examples, the key message to be conveyed from the original text is captured in the opening sentence or phrase. The underground economy is heavily influenced by tax policy. This is, however, often neglected by theoretical tax models, who usually assume that everyone follows the rule. In fact, as responses to tax changes vary, many honest citizens are prepared to commit tax crime (Spiro, 2013).  According to Spiro (2013), even honest citizens are likely to break the law to evade taxes when faced with changes in tax policy, as responses to tax changes vary between individuals. Despite this, many theoretical tax models often neglect the importance of the effect of tax policy change over the economy.  Spiro, in Tax Policy and the Underground Economy (2013), argues that theoretical tax models are wrong to overlook the effect that tax policy has on the underground economy because they unrealistically assume that every taxpayer follows the rules. In fact, different people respond differently to tax changes, and many may even commit tax crime when faced with such a problem.

My eQuals - digital academic documents UOW is working towards making digital academic documents available to students in the second half of 2018 through My eQuals, a secure third party provider of certified digital academic documents. Through My eQuals, UOW will digitally issue:TranscriptsTestamursAustralian Higher Education Graduation Statements (AHEGS), andUOWx Awards and UOWx Records (where relevant).My eQuals provides a number of benefits for users, including:-   A secure platform for universities to host and authenticate official digital academic documents, Anytime, anywhere access for students to their digitally issued documents, Once issued, students can share their certified digital documents with nominated third parties, and  Third parties can use the platform for education verification, via online access to an official document (once it has been shared by a student)  Having access to digital academic documents stored on a secure platform avoids the need for students to hold multiple original or certified copies of their academic documents, ultimately saving time, paper and money.    


When will digital academic documents be available?From December 2018, onshore graduating students will receive their official academic documents digitally, via My eQuals. For specific information about graduation and receiving your official digital and hardcopy documents, visit the Graduation website.Current (and past) students will also be able to request digital documents later in 2018, via the Official UOW Documentation webpage. A communication will be sent out when this service becomes available.

Global Communicators Program


Did you know that the students at UOW represent over 140 of the world’s countries? Global Communicators is a fun and informal way to meet other students, to have interesting conversations in English, to share your culture and to build international friendships and networks.
Each Global Communicators Program (GCP) session is coordinated by two students who are passionate about the importance of forming intercultural friendships, building cultural literacy and being global citizens. Read more about the leaders here.   





GCP is a community of UOW students who are passionate about being global citizens. By participating in interesting and engaging conversations (in English), you will get an opportunity to learn about different cultures and connect with people from around the world in a relaxed, friendly environment. GCP is also a great way to complement your studies at UOW, by enhancing your understanding of other cultures – a vital skillset in a global workforce. If you are an International Student and are wanting to attend workshops that are specific to enhancing your academic language skills please visit Learning Development. If you would also like to connect with the local community or attend seminars about Australian Culture, please visit Illawarra Friends of International Students (IFIS) and UOW Student Life. GCP, together with these and many other services/ experiences at UOW can contribute to making your time as a UOW student memorable.


This is a SAF funded program. Read more information about SAF here.

Call for Associate Editor - Journal of Peer Learning - PASS @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/services/pass/UOW246876.html,"


Call for Associate Editor - Journal of Peer LearningThe Journal of Peer Learning is an open-access, annual refereed journal established in 2008.  The Journal of Peer Learning disseminates scholarly work relating to peer learning across a variety of contexts, with an emphasis upon the use of peer learning in higher education.  More specifically, the Journal seeks to publish scholarly research that investigates innovations in peer learning including the implementation of programs in varied organisational and cultural contexts and evaluations of such programs that provide an evidential basis for the peer learning activities.The Journal is currently accepting nominations (including self-nominations) for the role of Associate Editor. Associate Editors serve a three-year term (July 2018 – June 2021) and can anticipate being asked to case manage approximately six manuscripts per year for the duration of their term.  This involves performing an initial review of manuscripts to evaluate their fit with the aims and scope of the Journal, sending appropriate manuscripts out for double-blind review, and then working with the Editor to make a final disposition/decision regarding each paper.Associate Editors should hold advanced degrees (Ph.D. or equivalent preferred); have a minimum of five years’ experience in higher education; be affiliated with an accredited college or university; and have expertise in quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods research design and analysis. Further, Associate Editors should commit to sending manuscripts out for review within two weeks of receipt.  Finally, Associate Editors should understand the importance of their dual role of gatekeeper and shaper of research in the field of peer learning and facilitate a rigorous review of manuscripts submitted for publication while also offering constructive and encouraging feedback to mentor fellow researchers.Individuals who meet these qualifications are invited to submit the following information to Dr. Bryce Bunting, Editor, at bryce_bunting@byu.eduLetter of intent including a list of specific scholarly interests related to peer learning(e.g., peer learning in the first-year experience, peer learning in academic contexts, peer learning in student affairs) and interest in reviewing studies employing qualitative, quantitative, and/or mixed methodsCurrent curriculum vitaeThe deadline for receipt of completed nomination packages is July 31, 2018. ",,"['field', 'provide', 'qualitative', 'investigates', 'interests', 'work', 'mentor', 'accredited', 'disseminates', 'evaluate', 'evaluations', 'fit', 'individuals', 'dr', 'relating', 'associate', 'scope', 'education', 'understand', 'vitaethe', 'years', 'serve', 'including', 'advanced', 'journal', 'year', 'design', 'anticipate', 'programs', 'manage', 'annual', 'established', 'deadline', 'employing', 'disposition/decision', '/', 'double-blind', 'equivalent', 'bryce_bunting', 'term', 'finally', 'first-year', 'experience', 'reviewing', 'paper', 'editor', 'importance', 'seeks', 'basis', 'specifically', 'mixed', 'june', 'research', 'working', 'review', 'editors', 'publication', 'related', 'affiliated', 'college', 'methods', 'implementation', 'quantitative', 'specific', 'nomination', 'july', 'evidential', 'byu', 'hold', 'refereed', 'manuscripts', 'aims', 'commit', 'role', 'asked', 'list', 'degrees', 'make', 'sending', 'submit', 'intent', 'dual', 'peer', 'eduletter', 'interest', 'packages', 'learningthe', 'shaper', 'duration', 'initial', 'expertise', 'ph', 'gatekeeper', 'call', 'accepting', 'final', 'rigorous', 'nominations', 'researchers', 'student', 'organisational', 'bunting', 'performing', 'innovations', 'bryce', 'constructive', 'learning', 'qualifications', 'information', 'involves', 'emphasis', 'fellow', 'cultural', 'approximately', 'weeks', 'preferred', 'submitted', 'three-year', 'varied', 'university', 'minimum', 'meet', 'publish', 'completed', 'scholarly', 'activities', 'receipt', 'methodscurrent', 'curriculum', 'encouraging', 'invited', 'affairs', 'offering', 'contexts', 'feedback', 'variety', 'facilitate', 'case', 'academic', 'studies', 'higher', 'self-nominations', 'analysis', 'open-access']"

Costs - Student exchange & study overseas @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/exchange/costs/index.html,"


Costs of studying overseas The following are costs that you will need to budget for when preparing for your overseas study:  UOW Exchange Program Fee ($150): This administration fee is payable after your acceptance to the UOW International Student Exchange Program. Please note this fee does not apply for short courses. UOW Fees (tuition fees): As an Exchange Student, you will continue to pay your tuition fees to UOW, rather than to your host university. This makes exchange a more affordable way to study overseas. You will be billed for 24 credit points in the faculty that 'owns' your UOW degree. Australian students may choose to defer part or all of their tuition fees via HECS. International Students must pay the full tuition fee direct to UOW by census date.  Passport (approx. $240): If you do not already have an Australian passport, or need to renew an existing one, visit www.passports.gov.au for application and fee information.  Visa Fees (varies by destination):  In most cases you will need to obtain a student visa for your host country and a tourist visa for any other countries you may be travelling to. Visa fees can be verified by contacting the Embassy or Consulate of the relevant country. All visa enquiries should be directed to the relevant Embassy or Consulate.  Insurance* ($0 for first 365 days):  All students are automatically covered by UOW's comprehensive travel insurance policy for the first 365 days of their overseas study.  Flight (varies): Contact your travel agent or search online to obtain a quote. Make sure you have been accepted before you book your flights. Living Expenses (varies):  All living expenses associated with overseas study are your responsibility. These costs and accommodation costs can be found on your host university website or may be communicated to you once you have made applied to the host university ^. Returned students are also a great resource for this kind of information. Some costs may include:   Accommodation Food Textbooks Transport Entertainment   UOW Faculty-Led Overseas Program: Several UOW subjects involve a compulsory overseas component – often a study tour where the whole class travels overseas together. In these cases, students enrol directly in a UOW subject, pay subject fees directly to UOW, and are guided through the short course application process by their UOW subject coordinator/s. Enquiries about these programs and subjects should be directed to the relevant Faculty International Office.   * You may be required to purchase health insurance (beyond the travel insurance that UOW provides) through your host university for the duration of your exchange. Your host university will advise you if this is required.  ^ Some host universities may charge additional costs to cover the student services offered there.  ",,"['points', 'responsibility', 'guided', 'charge', 'approx', 'destination', 'budget', 'census', 'days', 'fee', 'entertainment', 'expenses', 'faculty-led', 'made', 'policy', 'accepted', 'passports', 'verified', 'communicated', 'tourist', 'costs', 'covered', 'travels', 'direct', 'insurance', 'programs', 'administration', 'cases', 'enquiries', 'returned', 'obtain', 'choose', 'living', 'au', 'affordable', 'www', 'transport', 'billed', 'australian', 'continue', 'varies', 'subjects', 'courses', 'part', 'host', 'compulsory', 'book', 'short', 'applied', 'office', 'kind', 'passport', 'tuition', 'program', 'credit', 'uow', 'defer', 'faculty', 'gov', 'application', 'visa', 'degree', 'acceptance', 'make', 'coordinator/', 'international', 'owns', 'studying', 'duration', 'accommodation', 'health', 'class', 'makes', 'note', 'existing', 'country', 'food', 'involve', 'comprehensive', 'travelling', 'quote', 'additional', 'renew', 'student', 'tour', 'fees', 'exchange', 'enrol', 'universities', 'information', 'flights', 'online', 'preparing', 'include', 'subject', 'university', 'consulate', 'website', 'payable', 'directly', 'component', 'relevant', 'flight', 'travel', 'visit', 'embassy', 'advise', 'process', 'study', 'students', 'found', 'required', 'directed', 'resource', 'offered', 'great', 'overseas', 'full', 'purchase', 'textbooks', 'contacting', 'apply', 'services', 'automatically', 'contact', 'cover', 'agent', 'pay', 'countries', 'search', 'hecs', 'date']"

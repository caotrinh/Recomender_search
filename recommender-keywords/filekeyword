       Employers One of the key drivers for UOWx is to help students increase their employability. In the process of creating UOWx, we sat down with over 25 employers from a range of industries and posed the question, ‘If everyone has a degree, how do you choose who gets the job?’ They all pointed to the skills and experience students had gained outside of the classroom. Each employer highlighted the importance of soft skills that are gained through work experience and volunteer opportunities.  When a student graduates from UOW they will have their co-curricular activities listed on their UOWx Record. Students who have made a significant contribution to their learning will graduate with the UOWx Award.  Want to get involved?Register your interest here!  Why choose UOWx graduates? UOWx graduates have met rigorous criteria around various learning streams, all of which were identified by employers as being necessary skills in today’s workplace. Each recognised co-curricular activity provides students with the opportunity to develop in a minimum number of skill areas, including:Improve a student's organisational skills;Contribute positively to learning of self or others;Develops effective communication and interpersonal skills; Demonstrates intercultural awareness; Develops a student's problem solving skills; and Develops reflective thinking skills to evaluate and articulate their impact and personal development.   How can employers get involved in the UOWx initiative?There are a number of ways employers can get involved with the UOWx program:Become a mentorStudents who are participating in the UOWx Award Program who we have identified as being extraordinary. *Provide more info about opportunity and then link to the UOW Mentoring section* or email us at UOWx. Become a UOWx Seminar or Workshop PresenterUOWx runs 5 workshops a year which allow students to develop skills in a key employability/niche on trend area UOWx are always on the hunt for passionate and enthuastic presenters with industry experiences.

32,Moodle - Learning Co-Op @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/learningcoop/software/moodle/index.html,"


Moodle

This resource will provide an overview of Moodle. We will explain how to access Moodle, how to access course materials and how to upload assessments. 


What is Moodle?
Moodle is a learning management system that is used by the university to host course materials, to submit or complete assessments, and to participate in discussions.
When you study at the university, you will be able to access Moodle sites for each of your subjects and for some extracurricular activities. 
 
What do you use Moodle for?
You can use Moodle to access important documents (like subject outlines, assessment rubrics, lecture slides and recordings), to submit assessments, to complete assessments like quizzes, to check your grades for assessments and to participate in discussion forums. 


Accessing Moodle Moodle can be accessed via SOLS after you have logged in, by clicking on the ‘eLearning’ tab.  After you have clicked on the ‘eLearning’ tab, you will be navigated to your Moodle homepage (see image below). In the Site Summary section, you will find a list of sites, including those for each subject you are studying this semester. 


Using Moodle    Accessing course materials To access course materials, like lecture slides or subject outlines, locate them in the Moodle site by looking for links that appear in a blue font. Click on the link and the materials will either automatically download or open in a new tab for you. NOTE: Each subject coordinator can set up their subject’s Moodle site in a variety of formats, which means that course materials may appear anywhere in the site. If you can’t find them, contact your subject coordinator.      Uploading an assessment To upload an assignment to Moodle, locate the submission link in the subject’s Moodle site.. The link will appear next to a hand symbol.   		Click on the ‘Add submission’ button at the bottom of the page, and click on the ‘Add...’ button. Follow the prompts to select and add your assessment. When you have added your assessment, check the box that confirms the submission is your own work, and click on the blue ‘Save changes’ button. You will receive a digital receipt via UOWmail notifying you that your assessment has been submitted. This process may be slightly different on different Moodle sites. It is always best to give yourself some leeway with uploading assignments to ensure that if you experience any problems, you have plenty of time to seek help from your Subject Coordinator. NOTE: If you experience difficulty uploading your file, it may be that it is too big. An easy fix is to save it as a PDF and to submit the PDF version.    Using a discussion forum   A Moodle discussion forum is an online communication system the lecturer can organise for the students in the subject to collaborate and engage in discussion regarding set topics by the lecturer. As a user, you are able to read and post messages that can be seen by the whole cohort of students enrolled in the subject. If the lecturer has organised a discussion forum for the subject, the ‘dialogue’   symbol will appear under the subject name to inform you that there is a discussion forum for this subject to which you can contribute.   Closing date of Moodle subjects   Each subject you have enrolled in for the semester will have a closing date, after which you will no longer have access to the subject Moodle site. The closing date information can be located in your SOLS account under the tab Current Session > eLearning Details. This will display information such as the session, subject code and name, site name, and available from/to dates. To prevent disappointment when the subject is no longer in your ‘Site summary’ section in Moodle, it is best practice to save all the lecture notes and any additional information that may be relevant to you before the closing date.   The Moodle Student Dashboard The Moodle Student Dashboard will display feedback on your activity and results for a particular Moodle site. The dashboard will appear at the top of a Moodle page unless the Subject Coordinator has hidden it from view. Click on ‘Show progress’ to view the feedback. To learn more about the Moodle Student Dashboard, take a look at the ‘Moodle Student Dashboard – Information for Students’ page.

33,Assessment Feedback - Learning Co-Op @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/learningcoop/assessments/UOW244730.html,"


Understanding Assessment Feedback This resource explains feedback and overviews how to use feedback to improve your learning. 


What Is Feedback? Feedback refers to the constructive evaluation comments on an assessment task. Feedback is a powerful tool that can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses, direct your attention to areas that require improvement, improve your quality of learning, and develop interpersonal skills, such as communication and critical analysis. Types of feedback you may receive at UOW include:  Verbal feedback: Feedback is given verbally by teacher or peers       Written feedback: Feedback that is given in writing alongside with your marks after your teacher has evaluated your work. This may either be in the form of written comments or scaled on an assessment rubric.       Marks or grades: You will receive a mark for individual assessment tasks and an overall mark for each subject – this is a form of feedback too.    Where can I find my feedback?  When you receive marks for assessment tasks, you usually will receive written feedback. If it is a hard-copy assignment, generally your feedback will be written by hand by the marker throughout the document. They may also use the marking rubric to indicate how well you’ve performed in each area. If it is a digital assignment submitted through Moodle, your tutor or Subject Coordinator may upload a document containing your feedback, or a copy of your assignment with the feedback written at the end. If you can’t find your feedback, contact your Subject Coordinator or tutor. They may also choose to provide it verbally to you. 


Understanding and Using Feedback  To get the most out of feedback, you should:  Approach feedback with a positive mind. Receiving feedback can be hard, especially if you feel you haven’t done well. Try to remember that feedback is a tool for you to improve your learning.       Don’t just focus on the negatives. It can be easy to overlook positive feedback in favour for focusing on the negatives. Positive feedback is just as useful as negative, so make sure you use it to your advantage.       Critically reflect on the feedback you receive. Ask yourself if you agree with the feedback. Take a look at your assessment and try to understand what the marker is saying. How could you have done better? Did you prepare enough before the assessment? Where are your strengths and weaknesses? What did the marker identify that you did well?       Identify what you have done well, and what area(s) needed improvement. Think about how you can use it to improve for your next assessment task.       Ask for clarification from your Subject Coordinator or peers. If you aren’t sure what you need to improve on, or if you don’t agree with the feedback, talk to your tutor or Subject Coordinator. It may also be useful to reflect on your feedback with your peers.       Document the feedback you receive. Feedback is a way for you to improve in the future – you don’t want to forget it! Keep track of the feedback you receive in a word document that you can return to when completing your next assessment task.       


Giving Feedback While at university, you will be asked formally (i.e., as a part of an assessment task) or informally (i.e., by your peers or friends) to give feedback on others’ works. Giving effective and constructive feedback can be challenging and sometimes uncomfortable. Our Peer-Assessment and Self-Evaluation resource outlines useful ways to frame and deliver feedback to your peers.",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"
34,Effective Headings - Learning Co-Op @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/learningcoop/assessments/effectiveheadings/index.html,"


Effective Headings

This resource will introduce the use of headings in academic writing, including how to use headings correctly and what value they add to your writing.


What are headings?

Headings are signposts that help you structure longer pieces of writing and allow the reader easily navigate their way around a document. The type of headings used will depend on the format of your writing: for example, a case study will have different headings to a report. Make sure that:


	the heading system is clear and logical
	the sub-headings all have the same font style at that particular level
	the wording of the headings and sub-headings is alike.


It is best to take a couple of minutes to work out a plan for your headings before you start.



Components of an effective heading
Graded levels
It is common for headings to be graded at levels to communicate a logical structure. Usually it is advisable to use a maximum of three levels, depending on the length of the document. Don’t forget that the aim of using headings is to make it easy for the reader to easily find their way around a written document – using too many headings and levels can create confusion.
Levels are created with the use of font type, font size, position, capital letters, boldface and underlining. You can follow a given pattern or make up your own system so long as it is consistent.
Example
Level 1: CAPITALS, bold, 14pt, centered, space below

Level 2: Lowercase, bold, 12pt, left justified, space below

Level 3: Lowercase, italics, 12pt, left justified, no space below
 
The headings used in this resource are a good example of levelling without the use of numbers; however, in longer documents such as reports or theses, numbering is extremely important to assist the reader in keeping track of what section of the document they are reading.
 
Information distributed into logical sections
Headings should be used to identify a section; they are not to be used for each paragraph. Your analysis of the question will be key to working out your sections and headings.
Example
Question: what are the competitive drivers involved in a differentiation strategy?
1. COMPETITIVE DRIVERS 
         	1.1 Differentiation strategy and current operations
         	Definition of a differentiation strategy
         	Describe the difference of the theory in the previous heading to what is happening in your industry/business
         	1.2. New strategies
         	Provide the marker with what your group deems a profitable strategy
         	1.3. Justification
         	Provide reasons for this new strategy and offer evidence of your decision
 
Linked with the text
You should try to introduce the topic of your heading in the first paragraph following your heading. This will announce to the reader what will be coming up in that section. Remember that a heading does not speak for itself: the text following a heading should always restate and reinforce the main idea of that section, as in the example below.
Example

Reward and recognition of teaching
    The reward and recognition of teaching has been a national focus in Australian higher education since…

 
Grammar
Headings are usually single words or short phrases without a full stop. The wording, style and punctuation need to be consistent when designing a heading system, especially the use of capital letters. This can be achieved by following these three rules:

ensure all headings are brief
ensure the wording of the heading is specific to the text that follows
follow a parallel structure (editex 2016)

Example
To follow a parallel structure, you need to follow a grammatically consistent pattern for each heading level throughout the document.




Using ‘ing’ phrasing for headings
Using noun phrases for headings




Defining teaching standards
Determining criteria
Proposing a framework




Definitions of teaching standards
Criteria for judging teaching standards
Proposal for a framework






 
EXAMPLE
With capitalization, you have a choice of maximal or minimal capitalization.

With maximal capitalization, all words except articles, prepositions and conjunctions are capitalised.
              Eg. Rivalry among Existing Firms

With minimal capitalization, only the first word of the title and any proper nouns are capitalised.
              Eg. Rivalry among existing firms



When using headings do not:

	use too many headings
	change the style of headings within a document
	number the headings unless asked, e.g. numbering is likely to be needed in a long report but not a short document
	leave a heading at the bottom of the page by itself
	stack headings (no text between them)
	write headings more than one line long
	use definite articles to begin headings (e.g. âA Function of Business Xâ should be âFunction of Business Xâ)

Cover Sheets This resource describes cover sheets and explains the process of locating one for your assessment. 


What Is A Cover Sheet? A cover sheet is a document that contains metadata about your assessment, such as the assessment title, your name and student number, your tutor’s name, and other relevant data. Cover sheets are used to ensure your assessment goes to the right place to be marked, and that the right mark is assigned to you. If you are submitting a hardcopy assessment, you will be required to attach a cover sheet to your assessment before handing it in.   Do I use a PDF cover sheet or a barcode cover sheet? Which cover sheet you are required to use will vary between subjects. Check with your subject coordinator if you are unsure.


Finding The Correct Cover Sheet For Your Assessment   From the Current Students page, click on the Cover Sheets button. Click on your faculty from the list provided.   Follow the directions on your faculty cover sheets page.  Print out your cover sheet and attach it to the front of your assessment before dropping it off.   ",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"

TurnitinThese resources will provide an overview of Turnitin, It explains how to access Turnitin, how to submit assessments using the software, and how to understand an original report. 


What is Turnitin?Turnitin is an electronic text matching software used by the university to prevent plagiarism.How does Turnitin work?The software compares students’ assessments against a database containing copies of academic publications, assessments submitted by other students, and a slew of Internet content, and produces an originality report that indicates how much of the assessment has been plagiarised.What do you use Turnitin for?When you submit an assessment via Moodle, you may be required to do so through Turnitin. If your subject coordinator has set up the appropriate permissions, you are able to retrieve the originality report for your assessment to check that you have referenced appropriately. In some cases, you can then resubmit your work after improving any errors. 


Submitting your assessment through Turnitin
If you are required to submit your assessment via Turnitin, the Turnitin icon    will appear next to the assessment title.
To submit your assessment, click on the Submit Paper button. In the window that appears, upload your assessment file by clicking on the Add File  button and following the prompts. When you have uploaded your file, type the title of your assessment in the box provided, and click the ‘Add Submission’ button .
Upon uploading your assignment, you will receive a digital receipt to acknowledge that your assignment has successfully been uploaded to Turnitin. Take note of your ‘Turnitin submission id:’ in case you need to refer back to it in the future.


What is an Originality Report?The original report identifies how similar your assessment is to existing works and provides information about the sources that it matches.What can I use the originality report for?You can use your originality report as a guide to help you improve your assignment and academic writing skills. The report provides an overall matching similarity percentage and feedback about your work in terms of: Content: correctly acknowledging someone else’s ideas and writing Punctuation: correct use of punctuation to identify direct quotes that have been properly cited Quality of references: inclusion of recognised authors and well cited papers Format of references: presented in the correct format with all details 


Retrieving an Originality ReportThe first time that you upload your assignment, it will take 10 minutes for Turnitin to generate an originality report. To retrieve the report, click on the assessment link on your subject’s Moodle site, and then click on the similarity score next to your assessment (see image below). 


Navigating an Originality Report
Your original report will open in Turnitin’s document viewer. On the right-hand side, you will see the toolbar pictured below.







Active layers button. When viewing your originality report, you can choose to view it with two layers – grading and similarity. The grading layer will only be available after your assessment has been marked.






Instructor Feedback button. You can use this button to access feedback from your marker.






Match overview button. The number displayed here is your similarity percentage. When you click on this number, the Match Overview will be display. 
All sources button. Clicking on this will show a detailed report on each match, including the source of the matching text Turnitin has identified. 
Filter button. You can use this button to filter the report to exclude quotes, bibliographies, or sources that are a particular length or percentage.







Download button. Click on this button to download a copy of your originality report. 
Submission information button. Clicking on this button will display details on your submission, including the submission ID, submission date and file name.




 


Using Originality Reports      The similarity percentage The similarity percentage indicates how much of your paper matched to similar works. There is no “magic number” percentage that you should aim for. Generally the lower the percentage, the better. A high similarity percentage may be caused by incorrect referencing (i.e., incorrect punctuation in citations) or by text that is too similar to other’s works. To reduce your similarity percentage, double check you’ve applied the appropriate referencing style and try to summarise  or paraphrase your sources. If you are unsure if your percentage is too low or too high, contact your subject coordinator.   Identifying matches When you open your originality report, a match overview will appear. This displays a list of sources that Turnitin thinks may be too similar to your work. When you click on a match in the match overview panel, the software will jump you to the part of your submission that is related to the match, as well as displaying a pop up of the text Turnitin has found in its database that has similarities (see image below).     Resubmitting your assessment In most cases, you are able to resubmit your assessment after viewing the originality report. After correcting any errors, simply resubmit your assessment the same way you did the first time. NOTE: Turnitin will take 24 hours to generate new original report for any resubmissions.    Accessing assessment grades and feedback To view your assessment grades and any feedback provided by the marker, click on the Instructor feedback button. The marker may have also left comments throughout your assessment. To view these comments, ensure the ‘Feedback’ layer is selected using the Active Layers button. You can then scroll through the assessment document to find the comments. Click on the comment icons  to view the comments.   Downloading and printing your originality report  Before printing your originality report, ensure the similarity layer is selected as active by clicking on the Active layers icon  in the main toolbar and checking the box next to ‘Similarity’. Then, click on the Download icon  . This will download the entire document. Your similarity report will appear in the last pages of the document. Print the document as normal through the PDF viewer.

SummarisingThis resource will help you recognise the importance of summarising and describe how summarising habits relate to smart studying, ethical conduct and effective communication. 


What is summarising?To summarise is simply to identify the most important information from a text. You are probably summarising every day without thinking about it. A summary is always much shorter than the original text, but there is more to summarising than simply copying some sentences from a source and leaving out others. Summarising is a matter of analysing and re-purposing information.What is to be taken in summary from a text depends on the type of text being summarised and the new purpose to which information is to be put. An argument, for example, would be summarised into a thesis statement and a few key points, leaving out all the explanation and detailed evidence. A research report would be summarised into the motivating problem or driving question, the type of method and the findings of greatest significance, leaving out all the descriptive and explanatory details and raw data (exactly what an abstract does for a journal article). A summary of a case in law would comprise of something like the facts of the case, the decision, the ratio and any significant obiter, including noting dissenting judgements. If you’re not sure on the best way to summarise a type of text that you come across regularly in a subject, try asking your lecturer or tutor for clarification.The introduction to every academic text you read (and write) should provide the reader with a summarising preview of what is to come, rather than discussing the details immediately.Why summarise?Writing a summary is useful because in the act of identifying what is important, you are analysing and evaluating information, and forming memories of what you have read or heard – which is half the job of studying for an exam. Having an accurate and short record of what you’ve read or heard is also a useful source of ‘digested’ information for use when you need to generate a new text that involves re-presenting others’ ideas.


How do I summarise? You can summarise a text in many different ways, depending on which idea or concept from the original text you want to use for your own purposes. In the summaries below, there are several things to notice:   The original text can be shortened a little or a lot. A summary could be a simple selection of key sentences without changing them, but to be most useful as a learning strategy, summarising usually involves identifying the key words of the original text.  The topic of the message can be changed by starting with a different element. Conciseness can be achieved by choosing words that in themselves summarise larger chunks of information.  You still need to reference where you have used another person’s ideas, even if you have summarised it rather than copied it verbatim.  Example Original text (from Spiro 2013) “One of the considerations that is all too often ignored in discussions of tax policy is the way it affects the underground economy. Theoretical tax models almost always assume that everybody follows the rules. In reality, the behavioural response to tax changes has a wider range of variation than the choice between labour and leisure. Many otherwise honest citizens are prepared to break the law in order to evade taxes. Once the underground economy is taken into account – in effect, the proposition that individuals may decide to “opt out” of the tax system – there is a whole new layer of complexity to tax policy. Taxes that may seem to be optimal without the underground economy may no longer be optimal once it is taken into consideration.” Example summaries   Theoretical tax models should not overlook the effect of the underground economy on tax policy. As responses to tax changes vary between individuals, many are ready to commit tax crimes when faced with such changes (Spiro 2013).  Even honest citizens are prepared to evade taxes when faced with changes in tax policy (Spiro 2013).

ParaphrasingThis resource introduces paraphrasing as a critical academic practice and provides examples to help you recognise what makes a good and bad paraphrase.


What is a paraphrase? To paraphrase is to ‘reword’ text, so that the information stays the same while other aspects of the communication are changed. From a learning perspective, paraphrasing is really the nuts and bolts of information 'processing', done as part of taking notes or drafting new text. It is the opposite of mindlessly copying information, and plays a central role in developing a personal understanding of something, as well as in avoiding plagiarism. Plagiarism is not only about failing to acknowledge a source of information; it is also about failing to make sense of information in relation to a new purpose and context.Being able to paraphrase well is a challenging and creative part of academic writing. Doing it well demonstrates: you have a sound understanding of the original source you have credibility as an independent intellect you are proficient and flexible in your use of English   In contrast to a summary, which would be far shorter than the original text, a paraphrase might be of the same length, or even longer. What defines a good paraphrase is not its length, but the degree to which the original text has been reworded and referenced effectively and appropriately to accurately convey the original meaning and source in the context of the paraphraser’s argument. Why is paraphrasing difficult? Paraphrasing is often much more difficult than summarising, as paraphrasing requires you to reword the original text while retaining the meaning and relating the information in the context of your writing.If you don't paraphrase well, you might risk altering the meaning of the original text. Example Original text (from Jagtenberg & D’Alton’s Four Dimensional Social Space): The education system has performed, on an even wider scale, a major task of social control, training the growing workforce in the discipline and work style necessary in a capitalist economy, and systematically conveying ‘acceptable’ — i.e. safe — social attitudes to the rising generations.  Note that in this paraphrase the use of ‘the major form of control’ overstates and therefore misrepresents the argument in the original text. According to Jagtenberg and D'Alton (1988), the education system is the major form of control in a capitalist economy.  Also, if your paraphrase is too close to the original, it is considered plagiarised. Example Note that this paraphrase closely follows the structure of the original text and includes many of its phrases, and thus, can be considered plagiarism. According to Jagtenberg and D'Alton (1988), the education system has performed social control in a capitalist society:  training the growing workforce and work style, and teaching 'acceptable' social attitudes  for the young generations.  


How do I paraphrase? While there are a number of techniques you can use to put something into your own words, such as changing the sentence structure and noun phrases and using appropriate synonyms, the most important thing you need to focus on are the key ideas that you wish to convey to support your argument.You can paraphrase a text in many different ways, depending on which idea or concept from the original text you want to use to support your argument. In the examples below, the underlined part is the main idea of each paraphrase. Original (from Spiro's Tax Policy and the Underground Economy) One of the considerations that is all too often ignored in discussions of tax policy is the way it affects the underground economy. Theoretical tax models almost always assume that everybody follows the rules. In reality, the behavioural response to tax changes has a wider range of variation than the choice between labour and leisure. Many otherwise honest citizens are prepared to break the law in order to evade taxes. Once the underground economy is taken into account – in effect, the proposition that individuals may decide to “opt out” of the tax system – there is a whole new layer of complexity to tax policy. Taxes that may seem to be optimal without the underground economy may no longer be optimal once it is taken into consideration.   Examples Note in these examples, the key message to be conveyed from the original text is captured in the opening sentence or phrase. The underground economy is heavily influenced by tax policy. This is, however, often neglected by theoretical tax models, who usually assume that everyone follows the rule. In fact, as responses to tax changes vary, many honest citizens are prepared to commit tax crime (Spiro, 2013).  According to Spiro (2013), even honest citizens are likely to break the law to evade taxes when faced with changes in tax policy, as responses to tax changes vary between individuals. Despite this, many theoretical tax models often neglect the importance of the effect of tax policy change over the economy.  Spiro, in Tax Policy and the Underground Economy (2013), argues that theoretical tax models are wrong to overlook the effect that tax policy has on the underground economy because they unrealistically assume that every taxpayer follows the rules. In fact, different people respond differently to tax changes, and many may even commit tax crime when faced with such a problem.

Join the Global Communicators community



Global Communicators Program


Did you know that the students at UOW represent over 140 of the world’s countries? Global Communicators is a fun and informal way to meet other students, to have interesting conversations in English, to share your culture and to build international friendships and networks.
Each Global Communicators Program (GCP) session is coordinated by two students who are passionate about the importance of forming intercultural friendships, building cultural literacy and being global citizens. Read more about the leaders here.   





GCP is a community of UOW students who are passionate about being global citizens. By participating in interesting and engaging conversations (in English), you will get an opportunity to learn about different cultures and connect with people from around the world in a relaxed, friendly environment. GCP is also a great way to complement your studies at UOW, by enhancing your understanding of other cultures – a vital skillset in a global workforce. If you are an International Student and are wanting to attend workshops that are specific to enhancing your academic language skills please visit Learning Development. If you would also like to connect with the local community or attend seminars about Australian Culture, please visit Illawarra Friends of International Students (IFIS) and UOW Student Life. GCP, together with these and many other services/ experiences at UOW can contribute to making your time as a UOW student memorable.


This is a SAF funded program. Read more information about SAF here.

46,Call for Associate Editor - Journal of Peer Learning - PASS @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/services/pass/UOW246876.html,"


Call for Associate Editor - Journal of Peer LearningThe Journal of Peer Learning is an open-access, annual refereed journal established in 2008.  The Journal of Peer Learning disseminates scholarly work relating to peer learning across a variety of contexts, with an emphasis upon the use of peer learning in higher education.  More specifically, the Journal seeks to publish scholarly research that investigates innovations in peer learning including the implementation of programs in varied organisational and cultural contexts and evaluations of such programs that provide an evidential basis for the peer learning activities.The Journal is currently accepting nominations (including self-nominations) for the role of Associate Editor. Associate Editors serve a three-year term (July 2018 – June 2021) and can anticipate being asked to case manage approximately six manuscripts per year for the duration of their term.  This involves performing an initial review of manuscripts to evaluate their fit with the aims and scope of the Journal, sending appropriate manuscripts out for double-blind review, and then working with the Editor to make a final disposition/decision regarding each paper.Associate Editors should hold advanced degrees (Ph.D. or equivalent preferred); have a minimum of five years’ experience in higher education; be affiliated with an accredited college or university; and have expertise in quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods research design and analysis. Further, Associate Editors should commit to sending manuscripts out for review within two weeks of receipt.  Finally, Associate Editors should understand the importance of their dual role of gatekeeper and shaper of research in the field of peer learning and facilitate a rigorous review of manuscripts submitted for publication while also offering constructive and encouraging feedback to mentor fellow researchers.Individuals who meet these qualifications are invited to submit the following information to Dr. Bryce Bunting, Editor, at bryce_bunting@byu.eduLetter of intent including a list of specific scholarly interests related to peer learning(e.g., peer learning in the first-year experience, peer learning in academic contexts, peer learning in student affairs) and interest in reviewing studies employing qualitative, quantitative, and/or mixed methodsCurrent curriculum vitaeThe deadline for receipt of completed nomination packages is July 31, 2018. ",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"

48,Costs - Student exchange & study overseas @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/exchange/costs/index.html,"


Costs of studying overseas The following are costs that you will need to budget for when preparing for your overseas study:  UOW Exchange Program Fee ($150): This administration fee is payable after your acceptance to the UOW International Student Exchange Program. Please note this fee does not apply for short courses. UOW Fees (tuition fees): As an Exchange Student, you will continue to pay your tuition fees to UOW, rather than to your host university. This makes exchange a more affordable way to study overseas. You will be billed for 24 credit points in the faculty that 'owns' your UOW degree. Australian students may choose to defer part or all of their tuition fees via HECS. International Students must pay the full tuition fee direct to UOW by census date.  Passport (approx. $240): If you do not already have an Australian passport, or need to renew an existing one, visit www.passports.gov.au for application and fee information.  Visa Fees (varies by destination):  In most cases you will need to obtain a student visa for your host country and a tourist visa for any other countries you may be travelling to. Visa fees can be verified by contacting the Embassy or Consulate of the relevant country. All visa enquiries should be directed to the relevant Embassy or Consulate.  Insurance* ($0 for first 365 days):  All students are automatically covered by UOW's comprehensive travel insurance policy for the first 365 days of their overseas study.  Flight (varies): Contact your travel agent or search online to obtain a quote. Make sure you have been accepted before you book your flights. Living Expenses (varies):  All living expenses associated with overseas study are your responsibility. These costs and accommodation costs can be found on your host university website or may be communicated to you once you have made applied to the host university ^. Returned students are also a great resource for this kind of information. Some costs may include:   Accommodation Food Textbooks Transport Entertainment   UOW Faculty-Led Overseas Program: Several UOW subjects involve a compulsory overseas component – often a study tour where the whole class travels overseas together. In these cases, students enrol directly in a UOW subject, pay subject fees directly to UOW, and are guided through the short course application process by their UOW subject coordinator/s. Enquiries about these programs and subjects should be directed to the relevant Faculty International Office.   * You may be required to purchase health insurance (beyond the travel insurance that UOW provides) through your host university for the duration of your exchange. Your host university will advise you if this is required.  ^ Some host universities may charge additional costs to cover the student services offered there.  ",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"

FAQ's


Where can I study? Depending on your discipline and major, you can go on exchange to one of our overseas campuses or teaching partners. The University of Wollongong offers degrees in a number of countries including the United Arab Emirates (Dubai), Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia.What UOW degrees are taught overseas?The most up-to-date listing of UOW degrees taught at each partner institution can be found by visiting:UOWD, Dubai CoursesUOW College-Hong Kong, Hong Kong Courses     INTI, Malaysia Courses SIM, Singapore Courses PSB Academy, Singapore CoursesIs it difficult to have subjects approved in advance to study in a UOW program overseas? No, because you will be taking UOW subjects in these locations. You can simply go to the subject database and see which sessions your subject is offered at the relevant overseas campus. Note that some campuses offer programs on a trimester basis rather than a semester basis.The advantage for students in their second, third or later years of study is that you can take subjects which may be hard to match at other universities overseas.You will still need to complete a credit for prior learning exchange program form.How does it work?It works like exchange at any other university overseas.You require a credit average to participate, you need to go through the exchange application process and are eligible for travel grants.You continue to pay HECS charges for the subjects you study at the same rate you would if you were taking these in Australia.On your transcript the session will be shown as the campus session in which you studied. However, unlike other exchange, you will also receive a WAM for the subjects you took at the relevant campus.Why would I want to go overseas and study UOW subjects?Some students assume that the experience of studying at a UOW campus overseas is too much like staying at home.In fact, your experience at an overseas campus will be as different as if you had chosen an international partner university – without the hassle of getting equivalent subjects approved.You will be studying in a vibrant international city, highly ethnically diverse, in terms of the students in the program as well as in the host city.You will have access to extra-curricular experiences which are different to those available at UOW in Australia – especially the close industry and business links with our overseas partners.You will also have access to support services and campus facilities at each partner institution. ",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"

VIDEO: The 'Journey of Joe' This video highlights some of the issues that might be faced by a student with disability who wants to participate fully in university life. It was created by CATS - an Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) funded project that aims to assist universities in meeting the requirements of students with a disability. Watch the video.

185,Weighted Average Mark calculations (WAM) - Student Central @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/central/wam/index.html,"


WAM (weighted average mark) calculations Want to keep track of your eligibility to graduate with distinction or enter a Law School Honours program? We can help you with the WAM calculator at the bottom of this page. There are a number of different WAM calculations for different purposes. The below WAM calculator is based upon the calculation used to assess eligibility to graduate with distinction or apply for law school honours. Other calculations may be used and assessed by your faculty for other purposes.Before you get started, make sure you read the important information below…


Graduating with distinction   Eligibility criteria for the award with distinction is set out in the General Course Rules under ‘Eligibility for award with distinction’ section A final WAM of 75 or more will mean you are eligible to graduate with distinction, provided you meet all other relevant eligibility criteria (see eligibility summary below) WAMs are not rounded up. So for example, a WAM of 74.6 will not be eligible to graduate with distinction This calculator should be used as a guide only. Final assessment of your distinction WAM will occur when you apply to graduate, at which time your record will be assessed in line with the criteria defined in the General Course Rules   Eligibility summary  Pass Bachelor or Masters by coursework degrees are eligible for graduation with distinction Students in undergraduate degrees must have completed at least 50% of their degree in a UOW accredited course Students in postgraduate degrees must have completed at least 75% of their degree in a UOW accredited course Double degrees are assessed for distinction under each degree separately If 50% or more of your subjects are graded with satisfactory/unsatisfactory, the degree will not be eligible All subjects attempted at UOW in your course will be counted towards your WAM (some exceptions apply). Any subject completed in another course at UOW, which has been transferred into your current course as approved credit will also count towards your WAM (some exceptions apply). Grades associated with credit for subjects completed at other institutions DO NOT count towards your UOW WAM, and should not be entered into the calculator Fail grades DO count towards your WAM, and should be entered into the calculator (includes technical fail (TF) to be entered as 49) 


Law school honours Please read the information regarding eligibility and assessment on the law honours programs webpage.  


Calculation The calculation used in the calculator below is as follows:   Sum of (subject credit * mark) / sum of (subject credit)  Eg:  ACCY101 - 65 - 6 credit points MGMT203 - 82 - 6 credit points ECON313 - 76 - 8 credit points  (65 * 6) + (82 * 6) + (76 * 8) / (6 + 6 + 8) =  390 + 420 + 680 / 20 =  1490 / 20 = 74.5

Tertiary Literacies Over the time of your study at the University of Wollongong you will be helped to develop a set of knowledge and skills that can be defined as tertiary literacy. Tertiary literacy comprises of the five literacies listed below:  academic literacy – the skills of reading, critical analysis, writing and presenting orally are essential for students to be able to progress and demonstrate their ability across the subjects they are studying. Learning Development provides resources and programs to assist students who wish to improve skills in this literacy; information literacy - the capacity to recognise when information is needed and the capacity to locate, evaluate, and effectively use required information. StartSmart - Essential Academic Information Skills aims to help students by providing the knowledge on how best to locate the information required to support their university studies; computer literacy - the ability to effectively use computer devices and associated peripherals and generic software to find, store, retrieve and manipulate data. Information Technology provides computer and network services to students, including access to SOLS for the management of enrolment and personal details. statistical literacy - the ability to think statistically and to effectively use formal statistical reasoning. Three modules are available on-line to help students acquire core statistical literacy skills.  professional practices - the transfer and application of knowledge, values, attitudes and skills gained from university study to work and life settings including the management of a professional career. Careers Central can assist students to develop skills and experiences that assist with the transition from study to work.  Each of these literacies contribute to building your knowledge and skills to assist you to develop the qualities of a University of Wollongong Graduate.",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"

What is sexual assault and sexual harassment? Sexual assault is a crime, that can happen to anyone, of any age, gender, cultural background or sexual orientation. Sexual assault occurs when a person is forced, coerced or tricked into sexual acts against their will or without their consent, or if a child or young person under 18 is exposed to sexual activities. Sexual harassment is any unwanted, unwelcome or uninvited behaviour of a sexual nature which a person should expect will make the recipient feel humiliated, intimidated or offended. Sexual harassment can take many different forms and may include physical contact, verbal comments, jokes, propositions, the display of offensive material or other behaviour which creates a sexually hostile working or studying environment. Sexual harassment is not behaviour which is based on mutual attraction, friendship and respect. Sexual assault or sexual harassment can happen to anyone in our community. Female, male and LGBTIQ+ community members can be victims of sexual assault or harassment and are treated equally under the law. What is informed consent? To give informed consent you need to have an understanding of what is happening. A person who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol or who is asleep is unable to give consent. A person who is unable to understand what they are consenting to due to their age or intellectual capacity is unable to give consent. Additionally, consent needs to be free of any type of coercion, for example threats, intimidation or harassment.

What is SOLS and SOLSMail?SOLS is a vital student tool used by the University to manage student enrolment information. It is essential that students access SOLS regularly to ensure they don't miss out on important information.    Students should not skip University messages as they will risk missing vital information that may affect their enrolment, including penalties and fines.SOLSMail (or SOLS Messages), is one of the main tools the University uses to communicate important updates to students (e.g changes to a subject or an upcoming deadline). The University sends 'SOLSMail' notifications which students should 'read' and 'acknowledge'.Some helpful hints re SOLSMail are:Messages that are less than seven (7) days old will appear in a table at the bottom of the SOLS home page (most recent messages are at the bottom). Messages that are older than seven (7) days will pop up when students log into SOLS.  Students must read and acknowledge messages before they can continue to the SOLS main menu. Messages read (or were forced to read via a pop up) will appear in the SOLSMail History ViewAccessing SOLSFrom the Current Students page, find the SOLS login box (below):Type in your username and password; and Click LoginSOLS security It is important students keep their access SOLS safe and secure.  Please remember: It is a student's responsibility to keep their password and usernames secure to protect against un-authorised access of SOLS UOW staff will never ask students for SOLS passwords.  To protect from phishing attacks, students should not provide their SOLS password unless they are logging into SOLS via the Current Students pageIf using a shared or public computer, always log out after use SOLS will automatically log out after 60 minutes of inactivity (for security); and  The barcode on a student card can provide alternative access to SOLS (keep this secure and private).. ",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"
191,Plagiarism - Learning Development @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/services/ld/students/UOW021315.html,"


PlagiarismThis document provides information about the concept of plagiarism and ways in which it can be avoided.For information about the use of 'Turnitin' software (for text matching online and detecting plagiarism), please refer to your subject lecturer who is using the system for instructions in how to use it.1. PlagiarismWhat is plagiarism?Is plagiarism limited to words and ideas?Why should I acknowledge the work of others?What are the penalties for plagiarism?How can I avoid plagiarism?What is the policy for plagiarism at Wollongong University?Where can I get further assistance with academic literacy and conventions? i. What is plagiarism?Simply put, plagiarism is using the ideas, words, images or any form of representation made by someone else (authors, critics, journalists, academics, artists, lecturers, tutors, other students, and so on) without giving them proper acknowledgement. It is presenting the words and/or ideas of others as though they were your own - whether or not that information is plagiarised intentionally or unintentionally.You always need toprovide a reference whenever you include information from other sources in your work, andbe aware of the academic conventions concerning referencing. ii. Is plagiarism limited to words and ideas?Plagiarism is not limited to words and ideas; it also includes materials such as video and audio recordings, art and graphics, photographs, maps, diagrams, graphs and tables, computer programs or codes, research, and so on. This material can come from published sources, including books, journals, websites, films, newspapers and journals as well as unpublished sources such as lecture and tutorial notes and work by students.UNLESS IT IS CONSIDERED GENERAL KNOWLEDGE, ALL MATERIAL THAT YOU USE IN YOUR WORK THAT COMES FROM SOMEONE ELSE MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED.   iii. Why should I acknowledge the work of others?There are two main reasons why you should acknowledge the sources of your information:By not acknowledging the sources, you are in effect stealing (i.e. plagiarising).By acknowledging the sources correctly and effectively, you are strengthening your own work. a. Not Acknowledging SourcesPlagiarism is, in essence, an issue of intellectual property. If someone else has spent a great deal of time researching a topic, for example, then it is only right for that person to be credited for this work. Not acknowledging the intellectual property of others in your own work is the academic equivalent of stealing. The University of Wollongong’s policy on acknowledging sources of information states that if a student fails to properly acknowledge the sources used in her/his work, this is:unfair to the author;unfair to other students who do their own work without copying;failure to do independent work as expected in a university; andbreach of copyright.(http://www.uow.edu.au/about/policy/UOW058648.html) b. Acknowledging SourcesGenerally speaking, academic sources – statistics, facts, expert opinions, examples – strengthen your work by showing it is not only your personal opinion, but is also a well-informed and well-supported view. This is not to say that by including a lot of research into your work you will automatically create an academic text. To effectively use sources in your work, there are academic conventions that you need to learn, like when to use direct and indirect quotations and how to integrate evidence into your writing, just to name a few. These conventions are discussed in part v, How can I avoid plagiarism? iv. What are the penalties for plagiarism?The penalties for plagiarism can be severe and can range from a zero grade for an assignment or subject to expulsion from a subject and from the university. For this reason, you need to learn how to avoid plagiarism. v. How can I avoid plagiarism?Avoiding plagiarism is made easier by developing an awareness of academic writing skills and conventions. Some of these include:Efficient and effective note-taking and note-making strategies;An understanding of the difference between direct and indirect quotations;An understanding of the difference between summarising and paraphrasing;An understanding of how to integrate evidence from sources into your writing; andAn understanding of referencing conventions.Short explanations of these conventions and skills are provided below. It should be noted, however, that this information is highly condensed and is only meant to create a general awareness. The skills required to avoid plagiarism and to effectively integrate sources into your work are quite detailed. For this reason, links to pages within the University of Wollongong’s UniLearning website (http://unilearning.uow.edu.au) have been included to provide more detailed explanations and interactive activities. Finally, you should also refer to the guidelines for referencing within your faculty, as there can be minor variations across the university. a. Note-taking/ Note-making StrategiesEffective note-taking and note-making strategies will help you to keep records of exactly where you have found your information. There is nothing worse than finding information and integrating it into your work only to find that you can’t remember where you found it. Remember, if you can’t reference the information, you can’t use it. An effective and efficient method of note-taking is the Cornell Method as it separates notes into themes, notes, and responses, in the process helping you to develop a critical response as you read.To learn more about the Cornell Method of note-taking, go tohttp://unilearning.uow.edu.au/notetake/note12_cornell.html b. Direct and Indirect QuotationsAn indirect quotation is when you use the ideas of the author but use your own words. An indirect quotation must be referenced as the ideas are not yours. An indirect quotation can either be a summary or a paraphrase of the original and should not change the meaning by removing or adding essential information. The difference between a summary and a paraphrase is explained in part c.A direct quotation is when you use the exact words of the author in your work. Of course, a direct quotation must be referenced. There are specific conventions for using direct quotations in your work; for instance, direct quotations should be used far less frequently than indirect quotations. Also, a direct quotation should be enclosed by quotation marks, unless it is longer than a few lines, in which case it should be indented. These are just two of many conventions relating to the use of direct quotations.To learn more about using indirect and direct quotations, go tohttp://unilearning.uow.edu.au/notetake/note20_quotes.html c. Summarising and ParaphrasingA summary and a paraphrase are both indirect quotations; that is, they both encapsulate the ideas of an author but are expressed in your own words. There are two types of summary: an outline summary and a main point summary. An outline summary reduces a piece of text to at least a third the length of the original, whereas a main point summary is a sentence or two that states the main idea of a text or piece of text.To learn more about summarising, go tohttp://unilearning.uow.edu.au/notetake/note17_sum.htmlA paraphrase is usually about the same length as the original piece of text but is written in your own words. You need to be aware of acceptable levels of paraphrasing. Changing words and/or the grammar is often not sufficient. A paraphrase must be in your own words, and, as with a summary, you must not alter the meaning of the original.To learn more about paraphrasing, go tohttp://unilearning.uow.edu.au/notetake/note16_para.html d. Integrating Evidence into your writingWhen using evidence in your writing, it must be integrated in such a way that it supports your argument; evidence should not be presented as a substitute for establishing your own argument. A common mistake is to present a lot of information that is not integrated in such a way that it supports an argument. In such cases, the marker is left wondering how the information directly answers the question.To learn more about integrating quotes/evidence into your writing, go tohttp://unilearning.uow.edu.au/academic/4b.html e. Referencing ConventionsWhy reference? At university it is necessary to acknowledge the sources of information and ideas that you have incorporated into your assignments. Failure to do this thoroughly may result in accusations of plagiarism. While some students may view plagiarism as a relatively harmless offence, university departments take it very seriously.Referencing is not only about acknowledging other people’s work: accurate referencing and lists of references are beneficial as they allow readers to follow up information and read further into the area. This aspect of referencing will become more valuable to you as you progress in your studies.When to referenceYou should include a reference when you have incorporated an idea or concept into your work which is not your own (although you don’t need to include a reference when the idea or concept is common knowledge in your discipline). A reference is required regardless of whether those ideas or concepts are quoted in an author’s words, or whether they are rephrased in your own words (paraphrasing or summarising).How to reference: referencing systemsThere are two main referencing systems: in-text referencing (otherwise known as the author-date or Harvard System of referencing) and the notation system of referencing. These differ in i) the format of the references, and ii) in the location of the references. In-text referencing incorporates information on the author of the material cited and the date of publication within the body of the text, whereas the notation system places this information either at the bottom of the page (footnotes), or at the end of the text (endnotes). One disadvantage of in-text referencing is that the references may interrupt the flow of the text. Footnotes and endnotes, on the other hand, also pose a problem because they require the reader to look outside the body of the text for the reference.A comparison of the different types of referencing systems can be viewed athttp://unilearning.uow.edu.au/academic/4ciii.htmlDifferent faculties and departments have their preferred referencing system. If no guidelines regarding referencing are given in your subject outline or Faculty handbook, the best thing to do is to check with your lecturer or tutor. vi.

In doing so, the University has launched a number of programs and initiatives.Respect is... launch event | 19 September 11amThe University will launch the inaugural ‘Respect Is…’ campaign next week in an effort to continue the conversation around safe and respectful communities (SARC).One year following the release of the ‘Change the Course’ report, commissioned by the Australian Human Rights Commission and Universities Australia, it has been an imperative objective of UOW to address issues and instances not only of sexual assault and sexual harassment, but of common disrespect on our campus, accommodation and surrounds.‘Respect Is…’ centres around the notion that UOW believes in a culture of respect, safety and support for all and that sexual assault and sexual harassment is never okay. An event held on Wollongong campus Wednesday the 19th of September at 11am will unveil an interactive installation giving staff, students and the public to define what respect means to them.A version of the installation is also being developed for each domestic campus and only marks the beginning of an ongoing campaign.More than ever it is the duty of UOW to ensure everyone on campus feels respected, understood and safe.Event details:19 September 2018Outside the Library, Wollongong campus11amDraft Action Plan The University has created a Draft Action Plan that is designed to inform and guide the activities the University of Wollongong will undertake to provide a safe and respectful community at UOW.

 The Respect. Now. Always. campaign was instigated by Universities Australia in collaboration with the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) to increase awareness of the issue of sexual assault and sexual harassment at Australian universities. Launched in February 2016, the campaign focuses on the determination of Australia’s universities to prevent and address sexual assault and harassment across the sector. The campaign is key in raising awareness of the issue of sexual assault and sexual harassment and increase visibility of student support services. The campaign places a spotlight on student and staff wellbeing, and highlights the support avenues available to prevent and manage incidents. In late 2016, tens of thousands of Australian university students, including the students of the University of Wollongong (UOW), were invited to participate in a prevalence survey surrounding student experiences of sexual assault and harassment. On August 1, 2017, the AHRC released a National Report containing the survey results. UOW committed to publicly releasing its institutional survey data in conjunction with the National Report. Read UOW's media release and associated institutional survey results. Further information about the definition of sexual assault and harassment is available on the Australian Human Rights Commission website.

Staff are strongly advised not to enter into close personal relationships with students.

What is sexual assault or sexual harassment?

What is sexual assault?
Sexual assault is a crime, that can happen to anyone, of any age, gender, cultural background or sexual orientation. Sexual assault occurs when a person is forced, coerced or tricked into sexual acts against their will or without their consent, or if a child or young person under 18 is exposed to sexual activities.
What is sexual harassment?
Sexual harassment is any unwanted, unwelcome or uninvited behaviour of a sexual nature which a person should expect will make the recipient feel humiliated, intimidated or offended. Sexual harassment can take many different forms and may include physical contact, verbal comments, jokes, propositions, the display of offensive material or other behaviour which creates a sexually hostile working or studying environment. Sexual harassment is not behaviour which is based on mutual attraction, friendship and respect. Sexual assault or sexual harassment can happen to anyone in our community. Female, male and LGBTIQ+ community members can be victims of sexual assault or harassment and are treated equally under the law.
What is informed consent?
To give informed consent you need to have an understanding of what is happening. A person who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol or who is asleep is unable to give consent. A person who is unable to understand what they are consenting to due to their age or intellectual capacity is unable to give consent. Additionally, consent needs to be free of any type of coercion, for example threats, intimidation or harassment.

200,Offshore students - Online enrolment frequently asked questions - Offshore students @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/offshore/UOW225771.html,"


Online enrolment frequently asked questions (Offshore students) At UOW we're here to make your enrolment as easy as possible so we've compiled a list of common issues students encounter when completing their enrolment through our online system. Enrolment help information for offshore students:  Personal details tab: please check carefully that all personal details are correct. Visa type does not apply to offshore students.  Survey tab: is a requirement of the Australian government that informs institutional decision making and reporting. Students are encouraged to complete this survey at the time of enrolment, however, may update later in SOLS.  Photo tab: you do not need to upload a photo, so you can skip this step. Your photo will be taken by partner staff on enrolment day. HELP Loan/SA Loan tab: you will notice that this tab has already been ticked. You do not need to do anything here and can skip the tab.  Any questions: please speak with an onsite staff member if you have any questions about the enrolment process.    General information covered on this page?  General enrolment issues  Login  User account  Personal details  Survey  Photo upload  Selecting an offer  Subject and course enrolment  Summary   


General enrolment issues    Enrolment Jargon Buster At UOW you'll hear a lot of jargon, so we've compiled a list of some of the more common terminology you will encounter: SOLS: Our online student administration system. You'll be using SOLS a lot while you are at UOW. Find out more about SOLS. UOWmail: Your unique UOW email account. Not only is this account for life, but best of all it entitles you to up to 5 downloads of the entire Microsoft Office suite. Find out more about UOWmail. Moodle: Our online learning platform. You can access this through SOLS.   When should I enrol? Please visit the following link for details about partner orientation and enrolment dates.    Why do some screens have a tick? Each time you complete a screen you'll see a little tick appear in the navigation panel, a little warning sign will show you that you still have things to do. Make sure all the screens have a tick before moving on!   Are all the screens compulsory? Aside from the photo upload, you will need to complete all of the screens in the enrolment system before you are officially enrolled as a UOW student.   How do I know that I've completed my enrolment? Your enrolment will be complete once you have emailed yourself your enrolment summary on the final screen.   I've completed my enrolment but want to log back into the system, what do I do? Once you have emailed your enrolment summary to your email address, you won't be able to log back into the enrolment system. Don't worry though; you can make a variety of changes (including changing your subject enrolment or billing type) through SOLS.   I've enrolled, what do I do now? After you've enrolled in your course and subjects, you'll need to also enrol in your classes (tutorials, practicals and/or seminars).  You'll need to attend your Orientation Session. Orientation is a chance for you to get important information about your faculty and your course of study. To find out more about orientation, including when you should come to a session, please visit the following link for details about partner orientation and enrolment dates.    Back to top  Login    How do I login for the first time? The first time you login, you’ll need to use your UOW Student ID and date of birth. Your UOW Student ID will have been sent to you in your enrolment emails.   I’m having problems accessing the system, what do I do? There are a couple of things that can prevent you from accessing the enrolment system. Check the following are all correct:  Make sure you are using the student number that was sent to you in your enrolment email. Check that your date of birth or other details you entered are correct.  If these are all correct, speak to the onsite staff who will be able to assist you.  Conditional Offers: If you have a conditional offer, you won’t be able to access the system until the condition is cleared. Speak with an onsite staff member who will be able to help you.    What do I do if I’ve forgotten my username and password? If you have already created your user account through the online system, you’ll be able to reset your password or recover your username online.    Back to top  User account    What is my username used for? Your username will be used to access all of our systems at UOW, so make sure that you keep your username and password confidential.   Can I change my username? Unless there are significant and compelling grounds, you won’t be able to change your username.   Why do I need to enter recovery information? Recovery information will help you reset your password should you forget it. Make sure you enter an email address which you will have personal access to during university (not an agent or your school email address).    Back to top  Personal details    What do I do if my details are incorrect? If your details are incorrect speak with an onsite staff member who will be able to advise you how to change these details.    My visa details aren't showing up on the personal details screen - is this a problem? Our enrolment system will not always display your visa information so don’t worry if it is showing ‘Not Applicable’.   Do I have to provide an emergency contact, and if so, who should they be? It is important that you provide the University with someone to contact in the unlikely case that something happens to you while on campus. Your emergency contact can be anyone who you trust to respond to a situation. Common emergency contacts include family or friends.   What is the difference between Current Session and Permanent Home Address? You have to provide the University with two addresses, the one where you will be living during semester (current session address) and your home address, so we can contact you out of session or when your course finishes. Don’t worry if the two addresses are the same, you’ll be able to copy them across at the click of a button! If your details change at any time, you’ll be able to update your address through SOLS.    Back to top  Survey    What is the survey and why do I have to do it? The enrolment survey is an Australian government mandated questionnaire that informs institutional decision making and reporting. It is important that you answer questions honestly, as your responses will contribute to planning for support services.   What happens if I don’t know the answer to some of the questions? Don’t worry - you’ll be able to update answers later in SOLS.    Back to top  Photo upload    Do I have to upload a photo? You may skip through this screen as your photo will be taken by partner staff on or prior to, enrolment day. This will be used for your UOW student ID card.    Back to top  Selecting an offer    I have multiple offers, what do I do? Select the offer for the degree that you want to enrol in. This will automatically update our enrolment system which will show you as having activated your enrolment for this offer.   I’m unable to select an offer, what do I do? Most of the time, the enrolment system will explain why you cannot select your offer. One of the most common reasons for this is that you have an offer for future session dates.  Other common reasons that you won’t be able to select your offer include: having a condition that needs to be cleared or outstanding fees against your offer (international students only). Speak with onsite staff who will be able to advise on how to fix this.     What do I do if I don’t have any offers?  If you don’t have any offers, speak with the onsite staff member for assistance.    Back to top    Subject and course enrolment    What if I have an offer for more than one course? You may have a choice of more than one course. If you change your mind after you’ve finished your enrolment, you will need to withdraw from your existing course and return to this screen and enrol into another course. It is your responsibility to withdraw from the original course to ensure you don’t incur a debt for those subjects.     When can I enrol in my subjects? The date you can select your offer (and enrol in your subjects) will vary due to different session dates at partner institutions. Please visit the following link for details about partner orientation and enrolment dates.   Do I have to select a major?  Some courses will allow you to select a major as part of your enrolment. You can change this through SOLS at a later date. Some courses don’t allow you to select a major, so don’t worry if you’re unable to change it at this time.   What subjects do I have to enrol in? You can find out what subject you need to enrol in by looking at your Student Handbook or by speaking with a staff member. Adding subjects will make you liable for fees and charges.   I’m having problems entering my subject codes, what do I do? Double check the subject code is correct, making sure that there isn’t a space between the letters and numbers. If you are still having problems, speak with the onsite staff member for assistance.    Back to top  Summary    What does this screen show? The summary screen is the final screen in the enrolment system. It is a record of all the data which you have entered to date. If there are any mistakes, you should change it before sending your enrolment summary to your email.   Do I have to email myself the summary and what email will it go to? Yes, you do have to email the summary to yourself as this will act to finalise your enrolment. This will be emailed to the recovery email which you entered on the personal detail page. Once you have done this you will be locked out of the enrolment system and any changes will need to be made through the SOLS.    Back to top

Timetable FAQ'sWhen you have successfully enrolled into subjects for your degree, the next step is to enrol in tutorials (which are actual class times). If this is your first session at UOW, you may wish to view the Timetable and Tutorial enrolment video to walk you through the enrolment process. For all other enquiries, please refer to the following FAQ's, or contact Student Service for assistance.   When do tutorials openOpening dates and times vary for each Faculty and subject.  Be sure to check your Faculty opening times in advance.  When they have been opened by the Faculty, tutorials can be selected through SOLS via the 'Tutorial Enrolment' link. My “preferred” tutorial is full If your preferred class or tutorial is full, you may need to choose a different option.  However, if you have extenuating circumstances such as work, family commitments, or clashes with another class, you will need to refer to your Faculty (or Department) instructions  for assistance. All tutorial classes for my subject are fullIf all tutorials are full, you will need to contact you will need to refer to your Faculty (or Department) instructions for assistance.  My tutorial class clashes with another class or lectureIf there are no available classes to choose from you will need to contact your Faculty (or Department) contact who may be able to add you to the lass, or assist with a tutorial swap. What does EDU STREAM mean?Some Lecturers record lectures live (or remotely) and upload them on to the Moodle Platform for students to watch via SOLS.  Your Lecturer will discuss this (and attendance requirements) in the first lecture (or will detail the information in the subject outline). Which classes are compulsory?Refer to your subject outline (generally provided via Moodle). What is a Workshop/Practical/Computer Lab?Different subjects have different types of activity requirements.  Student timetables (for subjects) will specify what is required for each subject.  Lecturers will generally discuss expectations, and advise of specific attendance requirements (during the first lecture or detailed in the subject outline). What happens if I cannot attend a class?If you cannot attend a class you will need to notify your lecturer or tutor as soon as possible.  They will advise you on what steps to take (dependent on the subject requirements).   My tutorial has week 2, 4, 6, 8. What does this mean?This means that the tutorial is not held every week, i.e., only on the specified weeks of session (week 1 is the first week of session).   What are the greyed out boxes? Do I need to select a class for these?Anything that appears 'greyed out' is a lecture from a subject timetable.   However, you cannot enrol in grey items in tutorial enrolment pages.  Lectures that you 'have' to enrol in will be colour coded accordingly.  For assistance, contact your Faculty (or Department) contact for assistance. I am enrolled in a subject but the subject codes don't appear (in my tutorial enrolment) for me to choose a classIf you click on your tutorial enrolment and the subject does not appear, this may be because the classes have not been set up, i.e., it is too early.  Another reason could be that you may be allocated classes by staff.  If you are unsure and would like assistance, contact your Faculty (or Department) for assistance.   Why can’t I click on my class to select a time?Ensure you have familiarised yourself with the relevant colour coding for tutorial enrolment.  Ask yourself if it is before the first day to enrol , or is after the last day to enrol.  Remember you cannot enrol until the tutorial date and time has opened.  When a tutorials has closed, you will be unable to select a class.  For assistance, contact your Faculty (or Department)  to add you into a class (if the last date to enrol into a class has passed).  ",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"

Student Academic Consideration The Student Academic Consideration Policy enables students to request academic consideration for the evaluation of assessable components of a subject in a fair, reasonable and consistent manner.  Students are responsible for making reasonable efforts to minimise the impacts of medical, compassionate or extenuating circumstances on their academic performance. They are responsible for liaising with their Subject Coordinator when they become aware of an impact on their studies. Student Academic Consideration will only be considered for illness, injury, other serious cause or extenuating circumstance which:  significantly impact a student's ability to meet the requirements of a subject teaching/learning and/or assessment task (as defined in the relevant subject outline)  are beyond the students control, not due to their action or inaction, and  are supported by documentary evidence outlined in Section 9 of the Student Academic Consideration Policy (the Policy).   Considerations Prior to submitting an Academic Consideration application, students must familiarise themselves with the Policy and supporting Summary Guidelines for Students.  A summary of important information is as follows:   Eligible circumstances Non-eligible circumstances How to apply Providing supporting documentary evidence (via the Student Academic Consideration Portal, or in person as per your Campus instructions) Application response times Outcomes  Further assistance Students who are unsure whether their circumstance qualifies are encouraged to:  Read the Student Academic Consideration Policy and Summary Guideline for Students.

212,Student Complaints - Current students @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/complaints/UOW008298.html,"




Complaints The University aims to treat any concern or complaint seriously, and will seek a resolution as quickly as possible. What is a complaint? If you have experienced a problem with a UOW service, product, staff member or student, and you would like a formal investigation to commence, then you should let us know by submitting a formal complaint. This page will explain the process for you. If you have general feedback i.e. suggestions, praise, or a concern (and you are not requesting a formal investigation) feedback can be submitted via UOW's Feedback portal. Complaint resolution process 


Step 1 - resolve informally Self-managed stage – wherever possible, UOW encourages individuals to attempt to resolve the issue at the first level i.e., with the respective area/person, service, before lodging a formal complaint. If you are a student, you are encouraged to work through the matters of concern with the appropriate staff member (closest to the situation) as this is often the most effective way to resolve issues without further escalation. For e.g., most issues can be resolved informally through discussion with your faculty, Tutor, Lecturer, Course Advisor, Head of Students or the head of the relevant academic or administrative unit. 


Step 2 - Submit formal complaint University-managed stage – If you are dissatisfied with the outcome at the self-managed stage you are welcome to escalate your issue through the formal complaint process.      Academic Complaints If you have a complaint relating to your studies, for example, about a mark awarded for an assignment or exam, you should refer to the process outlined in the Student Academic Complaints Policies:              Coursework Academic Complaint Form [PDF 373kb] [docx 267kb]   HDR Academic Complaint Form [.docm 76kb] Coursework Academic Complaints Policy HDR Academic Complaints Policy    Non-Academic Complaints If you have a complaint relating to a non-academic matter, you can contact the Complaints Management Centre     


Step 3 - Appeal process External Avenues – If you have followed all internal complaint resolution processes, you are welcome to refer your matter to an external body. The NSW Ombudsman is one avenue you can use to make a complaint about administrative actions and decisions of the University. If you have not followed the University's internal grievance procedures, the Ombudsman may ask you to do so before accepting the complaint.

The University of Wollongong wants all of its students to succeed in their studies but recognises that sometime life experiences make this harder for some students than for others.
Research has shown that if you are:

an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander student
a student from a family with a low income
a student who speaks English as a second language
a student with a disability
a female student who is studying in a non-traditional area (e.g. engineering)
a student who cares for someone with a disability
a student from a rural or isolated area

starting at uni and successfully completing your studies can be a bit more difficult than for other students.
Student Support Advisers (SSAs) can give you information about the support available and programs that may make your time at uni a little more manageable. We also provide you with personal support and can refer your to any community services that may be of assistance.

Student Visa
Your student visa allows you to stay in Australia while you are studying. Australian immigration laws are very strict and if you do not comply with the conditions on your visa, you might have your visa cancelled and have to leave the country. If this happens you may not be able to return to Australia for another 3 years.
Your student visa should be valid at all times: if you allow it to lapse, you will have to leave the country and re-apply for a new visa to come to Australia. To avoid this you should apply on line with DIAC to renew your visa before it it due. Give yourself at lease 2 months before your visa is due to start applying. Don't leave it too late!
Visa information and student conditions are updated regularly so it is important to always check your information is correct and up-to-date. There are a number of ways to do this which are listed below:

Visit the International Student Website. Through the International Student Website you can access International Student Administration and Visa information.
    The International Student Website also provides information regarding the ESOS legislation and National Code and its implications for International Students. This site is updated regularly so be sure to have a look regularly.

Student Support Advisers (SSAs) are based in each of the faculties and provide a liaison, referral and support service to all students. If you have any concerns that are of a non-academic nature go and see your SSA. Follow the link to the contact details and the faculties for each of the SSA. They can also help you with more complex problems relating to your visa renewal or applications or any difficulties you are having with university processes.  If you need help go and see your SSA as soon as possible.      
        
DIAC. If you have any questions and are unsure of the correct process or information it is always a good idea to check directly with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. DIAC has a comprehensive student visa website which can be found at http://www.immi.gov.au/students/ and also run a number of different information telephone lines. For general enquiries and information call 131881.

Immigration Advice
In Australia, only certain people can provide migration advice to people who wish to enter or stay in Australia. Immigration laws are very complex and DIAC regulations change frequently. Under Australian law, only government registered Migration Agents may give immigration advice. If you do decide to see a migration agent you must check that they are registered with the Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA). Registered Agents are listed on the MARA website and a list of Migration Agents can be searched according to where you live.
Most Migration Agents do charge a fee, so it is advised you phone and make an appointment and ask what fee if any will be charged.
DIAC are also able to provide advice about different visas that are available and the conditions and requirements associated with these. Have a look at the DIAC website at www.immi.gov.au or call their general information line on 131 881.
The SSAs are not authorised to give immigration advice and are limited in the assistance they can legally provide. If you are requiring assistance go and see your faculty SSA who can direct you in the right direction. ",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"

228,Student Ombudsman - Support & wellbeing @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/services/so/index.html,"




Office of the Student Ombudsman The University of Wollongong is committed to the early and informal resolution of academic complaints. The Student Ombudsman represents a dedicated position that focuses on the independent review of coursework and higher degree research students’ academic complaints. The role of the Student Ombudsman adds value to the University by providing a specialist area that aims to ensure processes are implemented fairly and, where necessary, improved. The Office of the Student Ombudsman provides a place for impartial and confidential review of these matters.  As a student you can expect to be treated respectfully, to be given a fair hearing and to receive equitable treatment.    What is the Student Ombudsman's Role? The role of the Student Ombudsman is to independently review undergraduate, postgraduate and higher degree research (HDR) student academic complaints that have not been resolved informally or through the formal Faculty level process. The Student Ombudsman is also responsible for the independent review of student academic misconduct appeals; students may appeal against the finding of a Faculty Investigation Committee if the appeal is based on a lack of due process or if there is new and substantial evidence that has not previously been considered.  As Chair of the Coursework Exclusion Appeals Committee, the Student Ombudsman continues to oversee the Stage 2 Coursework Student Course Progress appeals process. The Student Ombudsman's Terms of Reference can be found here.  Who is the Student Ombudsman?  Associate Professor Margaret Wallace is the Student Ombudsman. Margaret has worked at UOW for over 20 years as a Sub Dean, a Course Coordinator and also as an Academic Developer.  She has led a number of projects including those on Assessment Moderation and the Development of a Course Coordinator (APD) Role Statement and been involved in educational research, including a national project on academic integrity.. She is committed to supporting the quality of the student learning experience by offering timely, fair and well-considered outcomes for student academic complaints that cannot be resolved at Faculty level.  More recently, Margaret has provided curriculum expertise in Learning, Teaching and Curriculum, a role which she will continue on a part-time basis.   What is an Academic Complaint? An academic complaint is a complaint concerning a decision, act or omission of a member of UOW staff or committee that affects a student's academic experience.  When CAN I Lodge an Academic Complaint with the Student Ombudsman? Coursework Student Academic Complaints - Stage 2 Review by Student Ombudsman You need to have lodged a formal academic complaint with your Faculty in the first instance and have completed Stage 1A and Stage 1B of the formal Faculty complaints process i.e. a review by the Head of School (Stage 1a) and a review by the Faculty Designate (Stage 1b).   If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint on the basis that:  you do not believe the outcome of Stage 1  is supported by the available evidence; due process has not been adhered to by the Faculty; or relevant new or additional information is now available that was not available at Stage 1A and 1B.  you may appeal to the Student Ombudsman within ten (10) working days of the date you receive the outcome of your Stage 1B review by the Faculty Designate.  For Higher Degree Research (HDR) Student Academic Complaints You must lodge a formal academic complaint with your Faculty in the first instance and complete Stage 1 of the formal Faculty complaints process.   If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint on the basis that:  you do not believe the outcome of Stage 1 of the process is supported by the available evidence; due process has not been adhered to by the Faculty; or relevant new or additional information is now available that was not available at Stage 1.  you may appeal to the Student Ombudsman within twenty (20) working days of the date you receive the outcome of your Stage 1 review by the Faculty Designate.  The Coursework Student Academic Complaints Policy, the Higher Degree Research (HDR) Student Academic Complaints Policy and Student Academic Complaints forms can be found here   What are the Possible Outcomes of an Appeal to the Student Ombudsman?  A number of outcomes are possible after all relevant documents have been examined and following interviews with the student and other relevant parties. The Student Ombudsman may determine that:  the matter will go no further if there are insufficient grounds for the complaint; or a basis for negotiation exists between the student and relevant parties; or due process has not been followed in which case a resolution involving the Faculty will be reached.  For Undergraduate or Postgraduate Coursework academic complaints, you will be notified of the Student Ombudsman's decision,  in writing, within twenty (20) working days and, where relevant, of the process for continuing your appeal. Higher Degree Research academic complaints can often be more complex and, consequently, the Student Ombudsman may take some time to thoroughly investigate a matter.  You will be regularly updated on the progress of your complaint, notified of the Student Ombudsman's decision in a judicious manner and, where relevant, of the process for continuing your appeal How Do I Lodge an Appeal with the student ombudsman? You can either email your completed complaint form and supporting documentation to the student-ombudsman@uow.edu.au, or you can hand deliver your documents to the Student Ombudsman's Office. Where Can I Find the Student Ombudsman? The Student Ombudsman's Office is located in Room 19.G003 (Building 19, Ground Floor, north-east wing).  Office hours are Monday to Friday 8.30am - 4.00pm.

Recharge




When you’re studying hard for an exam, often the first thing to go out the window is your sleep cycle. You stay up late, you wake up early… And even if you’re not spending all night studying, you’re spending all night thinking about studying, which is just as disruptive.
Recharge can help with that. The app helps track your sleep schedule, gives you some activities to do in the morning to get the blood pumping, allows you to track your mood, and – maybe best of all – comes with a super-loud, super-effective wake-up alarm.
Cost : Free




HabitBull




One of the hardest things to do when preparing for exams is getting into a good study routine. It’s just so easy to get distracted by the internet, friends, your phone or games.
Enter HabitBull. A motivational app, HabitBull allows you to track and input good habits, even giving you a score based on how well you’re keeping up with routines. It’s great for noticing patterns in your behavior, too: maybe there are specific days when you’re more alert than others, or maybe you tend to work better on the weekends rather than on week nights.

UOW Application for Refund of Fees - International form
General Information 
Student fee refunds for International students are administered under the UOW Fees Policy and the legislative guidelines of The Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000 and associated legislation. This is the legal framework governing the responsibility of education institutions for overseas students.
Once you have accepted an offer to UOW, your eligibility for a refund of fees paid to University of Wollongong is determined by whether you are a:

New student unable to commence study, or
Existing student who has completed at least 24 credit points of study, or
A student who is unable to study due to special circumstances.

This information page is intended to be a guide only. Assessments for Fee Refunds are made in accordance with the UOW Fees Policy.
Leaving the University 
Where International students are leaving the University, they must also ensure they have followed the correct procedures to be released or withdraw from their course before a fees refund application can be considered. For information on how to be released from the University please visit the Leaving the University web page 
IMPORTANT: Students should still complete and return an Application for Refund of Fees – International form available from the Student Forms web page, even if their release from the University is still pending. The request will be held until the release is approved.
Back to top
Refunds for new students 
A new student is a person commencing study at the University of Wollongong under a new offer. This includes packaged offers of 2 or more consecutive offers made for study at University of Wollongong. A refund request in this case would refer to the first session of fees paid in advance for your UOW offer. As per the UOW Fees Policy, UOW will assess refund applications based on the valid course offer.



Important Definitions

Commencement Date: The start date of the first session of new offer (As per valid offer letter and as published on the Session & Key Dates  web site.)

Census Date: Date by which enrolment and fee payments must be finalised. Each session of study has a census date and these are displayed on your SOLS record in addition to being published on the Session & Key Dates  web site.



Note: One full session of study may be made up of multiple intakes which equal 24 credit points. Where multiple intakes fall within the first full session of study, applications are assessed based on the first commencement and census date.

Back to top
What are Special Circumstances? 
Special circumstances are generally considered to be unusual, beyond the student’s control and were either not known before the commencement date for new students or census date for existing students, or significantly worsened after that date.
As per the UOW Fees Policy, you must be able to demonstrate with independent supporting documentation that your circumstances:

Were beyond your control – A situation that a reasonable person would consider is not due to your action or inaction, or which you were not responsible for. Please note that a lack of understanding or knowledge of university fees or census date deadlines is not considered to be beyond your control, AND
Did not occur, or their full impact was not known until after the commencement date for new students or census date for existing students – the circumstances occur before the commencement or census date, but worsen after that day, or before the commencement or census date, but the full effect or magnitude does not become apparent until after that date, AND
Because of the circumstances you were unable to complete your study requirements – You were unable to undertake the necessary private study required, attend sufficient lectures or tutorials, or meet other attendance requirements in order to meet your compulsory course requirements.

Special circumstances DO NOT include a lack of knowledge or understanding of census dates or the university’s enrolment and withdrawal processes. See the Examples of special circumstances and appropriate documents.
Back to top
What supporting documents are required? 
Each application is assessed primarily on the independent supporting documentation you provide to the university. Please note that a personal statement describing your special circumstances is not sufficient evidence to have your application approved. Personal statements of your special circumstances should be supported by documentation.
As per the UOW Fees Policy, supporting documentation needs to:

Be on official letterhead (if appropriate), signed and dated
Include medical provider number (if appropriate) and contact details of the person providing the document
Include all relevant dates and indicate the severity of your circumstances
Advise the date your circumstances first began
State whether your circumstances changed after census date and if so, the date they changed and to what degree
Comment on how your special circumstances affected your ability to meet study commitments
Advise when it became apparent that you could not continue your study

Depending on your special circumstances it may be appropriate to seek documentation from:

Your doctor
The Department of Immigration
Psychologist or counsellor
An independent member of the community (such as a Justice of the Peace or Minister of Religion)
Your Faculty

Back to top
Examples of special circumstances and appropriate documents 
Example 1 – MEDICAL
A medical condition became known after the commencement or census dates for study, OR a pre-existing medical condition deteriorated significantly after the commencement or census date and you were unable to continue your study.
Provide a letter from your doctor which states:

The date the medical condition began or changed
How the condition affected your ability to meet study requirements
When it became apparent that you could not continue your studies.

Example 2 – FAMILY/PERSONAL
Due to unforeseen personal or family reasons which occurred or worsened after the commencement or census date, you are unable to continue study. There are a wide range of circumstances which fall into this category such as:

A close family member has a serious illness after commencement or census date, and you are required to provide full-time care
A family member or close friend dies and you are affected to such a degree that, after the commencement or census date you realise you cannot continue study.

Provide a certified copy of death certificate, death notice etc, or a letter from your family doctor, counsellor or independent member of the community (such as a Justice of the Peace or Minister of Religion) which states:

The date your personal circumstances changed
How your circumstances affected your ability to meet study requirements
When it became apparent that you could not continue your studies.

Example 3 – COURSE RELATED REASONS
If your Faculty discontinues a subject after the commencement or census date and as a result you cannot complete the subject, or;
if you have failed to meet the University’s course progression rules and as a result are not permitted to re-enrol due to suspension and/or exclusion or;
you fail to meet the terms of your conditional offer letter.

Provide a letter from your Faculty which gives details of the circumstances affecting you.
Provide documentation to support your failure to meet course progression rules.
Provide documentation to support your failure to meet the terms of your conditional offer letter.

Back to top
What if I fail a subject? 
If you fail a subject(s), you will still be charged for the affected subject(s).
If you failed because of special circumstances which occurred after census date and were beyond your control, you may submit  an Application for Refund of Fees – International available from the Student Forms page.
You will need to provide evidence of your special circumstances with supporting documentation.
Back to top
What if I do not attend any classes? 
UOW encourages all students to manage their enrolments effectively online via the SOLS system. Therefore, regardless of whether you attend classes, if you do not ‘formally withdraw via SOLS’ before census date, you will still be charged for the enrolled subject(s).
In these instances, you should consider making an Application for Late Withdrawal Without Academic Penalty (available from the Student Forms page) if it is too late to withdraw yourself from your subjects online via SOLS.
Please be careful not to withdraw from subjects and affect your completion date which in turn, will affect your Confirmation of Enrolment at UOW (COE). More information about ‘Managing Your Course’ can be found on the International Students web page.

       Employers One of the key drivers for UOWx is to help students increase their employability. In the process of creating UOWx, we sat down with over 25 employers from a range of industries and posed the question, ‘If everyone has a degree, how do you choose who gets the job?’ They all pointed to the skills and experience students had gained outside of the classroom. Each employer highlighted the importance of soft skills that are gained through work experience and volunteer opportunities.  When a student graduates from UOW they will have their co-curricular activities listed on their UOWx Record. Students who have made a significant contribution to their learning will graduate with the UOWx Award.  Want to get involved?Register your interest here!  Why choose UOWx graduates? UOWx graduates have met rigorous criteria around various learning streams, all of which were identified by employers as being necessary skills in today’s workplace. Each recognised co-curricular activity provides students with the opportunity to develop in a minimum number of skill areas, including:Improve a student's organisational skills;Contribute positively to learning of self or others;Develops effective communication and interpersonal skills; Demonstrates intercultural awareness; Develops a student's problem solving skills; and Develops reflective thinking skills to evaluate and articulate their impact and personal development.   How can employers get involved in the UOWx initiative?There are a number of ways employers can get involved with the UOWx program:Become a mentorStudents who are participating in the UOWx Award Program who we have identified as being extraordinary. *Provide more info about opportunity and then link to the UOW Mentoring section* or email us at UOWx. Become a UOWx Seminar or Workshop PresenterUOWx runs 5 workshops a year which allow students to develop skills in a key employability/niche on trend area UOWx are always on the hunt for passionate and enthuastic presenters with industry experiences.

261,Student complaints - Have your say @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/haveyoursay/studentcomplaints/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=business,"




Complaints The University aims to treat any concern or complaint seriously, and will seek a resolution as quickly as possible. What is a complaint? If you have experienced a problem with a UOW service, product, staff member or student, and you would like a formal investigation to commence, then you should let us know by submitting a formal complaint. This page will explain the process for you. If you have general feedback i.e. suggestions, praise, or a concern (and you are not requesting a formal investigation) feedback can be submitted via UOW's Feedback portal. Complaint resolution process 


Step 1 - resolve informally Self-managed stage – wherever possible, UOW encourages individuals to attempt to resolve the issue at the first level i.e., with the respective area/person, service, before lodging a formal complaint. If you are a student, you are encouraged to work through the matters of concern with the appropriate staff member (closest to the situation) as this is often the most effective way to resolve issues without further escalation. For e.g., most issues can be resolved informally through discussion with your faculty, Tutor, Lecturer, Course Advisor, Head of Students or the head of the relevant academic or administrative unit. 


Step 2 - Submit formal complaint University-managed stage – If you are dissatisfied with the outcome at the self-managed stage you are welcome to escalate your issue through the formal complaint process.      Academic Complaints If you have a complaint relating to your studies, for example, about a mark awarded for an assignment or exam, you should refer to the process outlined in the Student Academic Complaints Policies:              Coursework Academic Complaint Form [PDF 373kb] [docx 267kb]   HDR Academic Complaint Form [.docm 76kb] Coursework Academic Complaints Policy HDR Academic Complaints Policy    Non-Academic Complaints If you have a complaint relating to a non-academic matter, you can contact the Complaints Management Centre     


Step 3 - Appeal process External Avenues – If you have followed all internal complaint resolution processes, you are welcome to refer your matter to an external body. The NSW Ombudsman is one avenue you can use to make a complaint about administrative actions and decisions of the University. If you have not followed the University's internal grievance procedures, the Ombudsman may ask you to do so before accepting the complaint.

Online enrolment help At UOW we want to make your enrolment as easy as possible so we have compiled a list of frequently asked questions to help you complete your enrolment through the Online Enrolment system.  Important information  Personal details  Selecting an offer  Subject and Course enrolmentFeesSurveyUploading a photo  Summary 


Important information    I’m having problems accessing the system Don’t panic.  You may need to clarify one of the following categories below before you can start your enrolment: Student type on admissions does not match - we just need to confirm you are a Domestic student. To do so, please email a certified copy of your passport and/or birth certificated to sc-enrolment@uow.edu.au                  Not a valid offer/ conditional offer - if you have studied at another University, UOW will require a certified copy of your Academic transcript.  A scan of this document can be emailed to the Future Students team for verification.                  Don’t know your student number - if you applied to UOW directly, your student number will be referenced in your offer letter/email.  If you applied via the University Admissions Centre (UAC), your student number is sent to you via email (within a week or so after receiving your offer from UAC) to your preferred email account.  Please note, even if you receive multiple offers from UOW, your student number will stay the same.  If you are still unsure, you are more than welcome to contact the Future Students team on 1300 367 869.   How do I login for the first time? The first time you login you will need to use your student number and date of birth. Your student number is referenced in your offer letter/email.Please make sure you have this information ready before commencing your enrolment.   When should I enrol? It is recommended that you start the enrolment process as soon as possible after receiving your offer letter/email and/or your offer to enrol email. Students can start the enrolment process 60 days before any session commences.     Can I use my smart phone to enrol? Yes, our enrolment screens are mobile-friendly. However, the system has been optimised for tablets, laptops and desktops, so your experience will be more user-friendly if you use a device with a larger screen.   Why do some enrolment screens have a tick? Each time you complete a screen the system will display a tick on the navigation panel (top of screen). If you still have things to do, the system will display a warning sign.  With the exception of the photo upload screen, you will need to make sure that each screen has a tick as the system will not allow you to continue while a warning sign is displayed. If all screens have not been completed, you will not be considered to be enrolled as UOW student.   I've completed my enrolment process but I want to log back in.Once you receive your enrolment summary via email, you won’t be able to log back into the enrolment system.  The good news is that you can change any of the information (including subjects and billing type) through your SOLS account.  This will be activated approximately one hour after completing the enrolment process. NOTE: If you have received a subsequent offer at UOW, you can re-enter the system and enrol in your new course.   Why do I need to enter recovery information? Recovery information is very important, it is there for you if you need to reset your password (or other personal information) at any given time.  Make sure you enter an email address that you have personal access to during your time at UOW. NOTE:  This should NOT be an agent or high school email address.  An appropriate example is a @hotmail or @gmail email account.   Enrolment language help At UOW you will hear a lot of jargon.  The following are some of the more common enrolment terminologies that you will hear: SOLS: SOLS stands for Student Online Services, and is UOW's online student administration system. It is the main tool UOW uses to update students on important information (concerning courses etc.).  You will use SOLS a lot during your time at UOW so it is important to keep your SOLS information recorded.  Find out more about SOLS. UOWmail: UOWmail is your unique UOW email account.  Not only is this account for life, but it entitles you up to five downloads of the entire Microsoft Office suite.  More information about UOWMail can be found here. Moodle: is UOW's online learning platform.  Over the course of your study, a Subject Coordinator may set up a Moodle site for certain subjects.  You can access Moodle through your SOLS account.    Back to top  Personal details    What do I do if my personal details in the enrolment system are incorrect? If ANY of your details are incorrect it is important that you do NOT confirm your details. You should contact Student Central who can help you update the information.    My visa details aren't showing up on the personal details screen - is this a problem? Our enrolment system will not always display your visa information so don’t worry if you see ‘Not Applicable’ for your visa details.   Do I have to provide an emergency contact, and if so, who should they be? Yes. It is important that you provide UOW with someone to contact in the unlikely case that there is an emergency on campus. Your emergency contact can be anyone you trust to respond to a personal situation like a family member or close friend.    What is the difference between Current Session Address and Permanent Home Address? Upon enrolment you will have to provide UOW with two addresses: 1. One for where you will be living during each academic session (current session address); and              2. One for your home address where we can contact you out of session.               Don’t worry if the two addresses are the same, you’ll be able to copy them across at the click of a button.  If your details change at any time, you’ll be able to update your address through SOLS ‘personal details’.    Back to top  Selecting an offer    What do I do if I don’t have any offers? If you can't see any offers, you will need to contact the Future Students team for assistance.    I have multiple offers, what do I do? Firstly, you will need to select the offer for the degree that you want to enrol in.When you have done this, the enrolment system will automatically update, displaying that you as having an activated enrolment for that offer.   I’ve been given an offer through UOW’s Early Admission Program, but I want to accept my main round offer?  You will be able access the enrolment system even if you have previously completed the enrolment process for your early admission offer.  To do this:Log in to the UOW enrolment system, and select your new offerWithdraw from your previous subjects; andEnrol in your new subjects.    Back to top  Subject and course enrolment    Why do I have default subjects? Some courses have core subjects that you must complete. The enrolment system will pre-populate the information for you, all you have to do is click the ‘Add’ button, it’s that simple.   What subjects do I have to enrol in? To find the subjects required to enrol in will be detailed in the First Year Enrolment Guide for your course, or the Course Handbook (relevant to your continued studies). If you're enrolling in a postgraduate course, you should refer to the UOW Postgraduate Course Handbook.   NOTE:  For 100, 200, 300 and 400 level subjects, please refer to first, second, third and fourth year subjects respectively.  Normally in your first year at University, you will only need to enrol in 100-level subjects, for e.g., ACCY111.   How many subjects am I supposed to enrol in? Domestic undergraduate students have the option of enrolling in as many subjects as they like. To complete an undergraduate course within the time-frame, i.e., three (3) years, students should be enrolling in four (4) subjects per session.NOTE: If you are enrolled in less than three (3) subjects* you will be considered a part time student which can affect Government benefits.If you are enrolling in a postgraduate course, you may not need to enrol in as many subjects as an undergraduate student. Be sure to consult your course's entry in the UOW Postgraduate Course Handbook. *please note law students must be enrolled in four (4) subjects per session for their first year.     When I try and enrol it says ‘Course constraint’. What do I do? This probably means that you are trying to add a subject that doesn't correspond to your degree.  Remember to check the First Year Enrolment Guide (if you are a new student), or Course Handbook for returning students.  If you are still having issues, please contact the Future Students team for assistance.      I’m having problems entering my subject codes, what do I do? You will need to ensure the subject code you are trying to enter is correct.  For e.g., subject codes need to be seven digits, make sure there isn’t a space between the letters and numbers for codes with seven digits (ACCY111), and that there is a space for codes with six digits (LAW 111). If you are entering the number correctly and you are still experiencing issues, this could be due to:    The last date to add a subject has passed (refer to Key Dates)The subject quota is 'Full'There is a Course Constraint (see above); or You have reached the maximum points for enrolment into the session.  For assistance, please contact Student Central for assistance.    I have credit for prior (CPL) learning – what subjects can I enrol into? Before you can finalise your enrolment, you will need to liaise with your Faculty who can help you with appropriate subject selection.  Faculty office contacts are as follows: Business: business-enquiries@uow.edu.auEngineering and information Sciences: eis@uow.edu.auLaw, Humanities and the Arts: lha-enquiries@uow.edu.auScience Medicine and Health: Smah-student@uow.edu.auSocial Sciences: ssc@uow.edu.au     I only enrolled in one subject, where can I add the rest? If you completed the online enrolment process with only one subject, you CAN change/add/withdraw additional subjects through your SOLS account.  To do this: Log into SOLS; andSelect 'Enrolments / Variations' (from the left hand menu.   Do I have to enrol in the following session’s subjects all together? If you are not sure what subjects you will be taking in the following session, i.e. Spring after Autumn session, you are not required to enrol during that session.You have plenty of time to enrol before each session commences.   What if I have more than one course offer? If you have an offer for more than one course you will need to make sure you only have a completed enrolment for your course preference, i.e. if you change your mind after you have finished an enrolment, you will need to withdraw from the existing course and return to enrol in your chosen course. NOTE: It is the students responsibility to withdraw from courses you will NOT be studying before the Census date to ensure you do not incur a debt for those subjects.  If you do not know the Census date, you can check this on via the Key Dates page, or through your SOLS under the 'Enrolment and Variations' area.    How do I select a minor/major? Some courses allow you to select minors or majors as part of the enrolment process.  However, some courses do NOT.  Don’t worry if you are unable to change the information at the time of enrolment, you can always change it through SOLS at a later date.  For more information on minors/majors, visit the Majors and Minors information on the Manage Your Enrolment web pages.     Back to top  Fees    When are Fees due? Students will not incur fee liabilities until the relevant sessions Census date.  The Census date changes from session to session and is the last date to:Pay FeesWithdraw from subjects without paying for them; andThe last date to change HECS / HELP billing options (if eligible).   You can find our the relevant census date by checking the Key Dates page, or through the 'Enrolment and Variations' menu in SOLS (for that session).   Can I change my preferred payment option? Yes, you can change your payment option (billing) through SOLS.  Remember, this needs to be done before the relevant sessions Census date.  To do this: Log into SOLSOpen the Fees menu (select Help-Loan Option)Click on the 'Maintain' button for your default billing type; and Follow the prompts.  If you wish to defer your fees, you will need to provide your Tax File Number during these steps.  Please ensure you familiarise yourself with all the information provided before you agree and continue.  When agreed:Submit your new billing preference (ensure you double check your billing type and TFN details are correct).   NOTE: Remember this must be done before the relevant session Census date.   What are HECS-Help and SA Help? HECS-Help is an Australian Government Scheme that allows ‘eligible’ domestic students to defer their fees.  SA-Help is a loan which covers the compulsory Student Services and Amenities Fee. NOTE: HELP-Loans and SA-Help are only available to Australian Citizens or Permanent Humanitarian Visa Holders.  Whatever payment option you decide on, remember to finalise options and payments by the session Census date (which is the last date to withdraw without financial penalty (refer to Key Dates).  If you do NOT settle your payment option by the relevant Census date, you may be at risk of having your enrolment cancelled.   What if I don’t have a TFN yet – Can I still enrol? Yes, you can enrol in your course without a Tax File Number (TFN).  A TFN is only required if you are an eligible student using the HECS-HELP billing option. To progress your enrolment:You need to select ‘upfront’ as your billing option (for now as this does not ask for a TFN); andWill need to change it to HECS-HELP (through your SOLS account) after you have received your TFN. NOTE: Once you have received your TFN, remember to change your billing option to HECS-HELP through SOLS.  You will have only have until the Census date of the session you are enrolling in.   I’m paying upfront; do I have to read and understand all payment options? Yes, even if you are paying your fees upfront, you still need to read and acknowledge all forms on the SOLS ‘Help Loan Option’ tab.  This will ensure you have read and understood all payment options, and can select the ‘full upfront payment’ as your billing option at the end.   Where can I get more information about fees? UOW fees will depend on your student type.Please refer to the Fees and Assistance webpage outlining fees and charges students may incur while studying at UOW.    Back to top  Survey    What is the survey and why do I have to do it? The enrolment survey is an Australian Government mandated questionnaire that informs institutional decision making and reporting. It is really important that you answer questions honestly as your responses will contribute to planning for support services at UOW.   What if I don’t know the answer to some of the questions? If you do not know the answer, you can leave the question blank.    Back to top Photo upload    What will the photo be used for? The photo that you upload will be used for your UOW Student ID Card after the first year enrolment.  You will need to keep your Student ID with you at all times: Student ID's can be used as UOW Library cards (access printing, scanning and copying services)Student ID's identify students (especially during examination periods); andYou will need your Student ID to verify your identity on Campus.    Do I have to upload a photo? Uploading a photo will save you time when you go to collect your Student ID.  However, if you are unable to upload a photo, simply skip the step.  You can always get a photo taken by UOW Staff at a later date.   Are there requirements for the photo? Yes.  There are requirements for your photo to meet before it is accepted.  You can find a full list of requirements online. NOTE: The system will allow photos which do not meet the requirements, however, if your photo doesn’t meet our standards, a new photo will have to be taken which will result in some delays.   I don’t like my photo, can I change it? Yes, you can change your photo at any time before you finalise your enrolment on the system.  However, once you have received your email summary, your photo will be finalised in the system. If your Student ID is generated and you don't like the photo, you will need to order a replacement card from Student Central (ground floor, building 17).  This will incur a cost of $10.00.   My photo won’t upload, what do I do? Double check the file format.  UOW suggests converting the image into a JPEG or a PNG before attempting to upload the photo again. Remember, this step is not compulsory so you do not have to upload a photo to complete your enrolment.    Back to top  Summary    How will I know that I have completed my enrolment properly? Your enrolment will be complete once you have emailed yourself the enrolment summary.  This is done on the final enrolment screen.   What does this screen show? The summary screen is the final screen in the enrolment system.  It is a record of all the data you have entered.  If there are any mistakes, you should change it before sending your enrolment summary to your email.   Do I have to email myself the summary and what email will it go to? Yes, you do have to email the summary to yourself as this will act to finalise your enrolment.  This will be emailed to the recovery email which you entered on the personal details page.  Once you have done this you will be locked out of the enrolment system and as such, any changes will need to be made through the SOLS.

 The Respect. Now. Always. campaign was instigated by Universities Australia in collaboration with the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) to increase awareness of the issue of sexual assault and sexual harassment at Australian universities. Launched in February 2016, the campaign focuses on the determination of Australia’s universities to prevent and address sexual assault and harassment across the sector. The campaign is key in raising awareness of the issue of sexual assault and sexual harassment and increase visibility of student support services. The campaign places a spotlight on student and staff wellbeing, and highlights the support avenues available to prevent and manage incidents. In late 2016, tens of thousands of Australian university students, including the students of the University of Wollongong (UOW), were invited to participate in a prevalence survey surrounding student experiences of sexual assault and harassment. On August 1, 2017, the AHRC released a National Report containing the survey results. UOW committed to publicly releasing its institutional survey data in conjunction with the National Report. Read UOW's media release and associated institutional survey results. Further information about the definition of sexual assault and harassment is available on the Australian Human Rights Commission website.


Safe and Respectful Communities (SARC) Draft Action Plan The SARC Draft Action Plan is designed to inform and guide the activities the University of Wollongong will undertake to meet our responsibility to provide a Safe and Respectful community at the University of Wollongong and respond to the nine recommendations of the Australian Human Rights Commission's report 'Change The Course'. Read the Safe and Respectful Communities Draft Action Plan. Written submissions are invited by staff, students and interested stakeholders via sarca-uow@uow.edu.au. The Draft Action Plan is open for consultation until Friday 10 August 2018. Feedback on the Draft Action Plan is welcomed by filling out the SARC Draft Action Plan Feedback form.


Creating a safe work and study environment
UOW is fully supporting the aims of the Respect. Now. Always. campaign and is dedicated to a continuous process of raising awareness, providing support and ensuring the safety and wellbeing of its students and staff. UOW places the highest priority on providing a safe study, living and working environment. Sexual assault and sexual harassment matters are dealt with under a ‘support first’ model and individuals are encouraged to report any incident to UOW for investigation.
UOW offers a range of free programs for staff and students, including:


Expand / Collapse Mental Health First Aid (includes violence prevention and consent training)  UOW offers Mental Health First Aid - a course that empowers every trained student and member of staff to help a person who is developing a mental health problem, or who is in a mental health crisis, until appropriate professional treatment is received or the crisis resolves. UOW Mental Health First Aid workshops for students include content from the MATES (Prevention of Violence) and the Consent Matters online module. You can find information on upcoming events here.  Step Up Bystander Intervention  The UOW Wellbeing Program includes the Step Up Bystander Intervention course. This course is a prosocial behaviour and bystander intervention program that educates students to be proactive in helping others. Teaching people about the determinants of prosocial behaviour makes them more aware of why they sometimes don’t help. As a result they are more likely to help in the future. Please note that details about this course will be provided soon.  International Student Programs (ISP)  International Student Programs connect students with people from all over the world, offering opportunities to make new friends, develop skills and link to the local community. Key programs that specifically support students are the Transition to Australia workshops, and social English Conversation Groups that connect students with UOW and wider community members.

UOW’s policies provide information on how it responds to and seeks to prevent incidents:
Sexual Harassment Prevention Policy sets out the University’s response model regarding sexual harassment for staff and students. It contains information regarding how to raise a complaint and seek help.
Close Personal Relationships Guidelines sets out expectations regarding staff obligations to appropriately manage staff-student relationships and relationships between staff members, acknowledging that these relationships can raise issues concerning the balance of power and conflicts of interests. Staff are strongly advised not to enter into close personal relationships with students. However, where they exist or develop, staff are required to disclose the relationship in accordance with the University’s Conflict of Interest Policy. Students are also strongly encouraged to disclose the relationship independently to their Head of School or other appropriate senior officer.

What is sexual assault or sexual harassment?

What is sexual assault?
Sexual assault is a crime, that can happen to anyone, of any age, gender, cultural background or sexual orientation. Sexual assault occurs when a person is forced, coerced or tricked into sexual acts against their will or without their consent, or if a child or young person under 18 is exposed to sexual activities.
What is sexual harassment?
Sexual harassment is any unwanted, unwelcome or uninvited behaviour of a sexual nature which a person should expect will make the recipient feel humiliated, intimidated or offended. Sexual harassment can take many different forms and may include physical contact, verbal comments, jokes, propositions, the display of offensive material or other behaviour which creates a sexually hostile working or studying environment. Sexual harassment is not behaviour which is based on mutual attraction, friendship and respect. Sexual assault or sexual harassment can happen to anyone in our community. Female, male and LGBTIQ+ community members can be victims of sexual assault or harassment and are treated equally under the law.
What is informed consent?
To give informed consent you need to have an understanding of what is happening. A person who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol or who is asleep is unable to give consent. A person who is unable to understand what they are consenting to due to their age or intellectual capacity is unable to give consent. Additionally, consent needs to be free of any type of coercion, for example threats, intimidation or harassment.

       Employers One of the key drivers for UOWx is to help students increase their employability. In the process of creating UOWx, we sat down with over 25 employers from a range of industries and posed the question, ‘If everyone has a degree, how do you choose who gets the job?’ They all pointed to the skills and experience students had gained outside of the classroom. Each employer highlighted the importance of soft skills that are gained through work experience and volunteer opportunities.  When a student graduates from UOW they will have their co-curricular activities listed on their UOWx Record. Students who have made a significant contribution to their learning will graduate with the UOWx Award.  Want to get involved?Register your interest here!  Why choose UOWx graduates? UOWx graduates have met rigorous criteria around various learning streams, all of which were identified by employers as being necessary skills in today’s workplace. Each recognised co-curricular activity provides students with the opportunity to develop in a minimum number of skill areas, including:Improve a student's organisational skills;Contribute positively to learning of self or others;Develops effective communication and interpersonal skills; Demonstrates intercultural awareness; Develops a student's problem solving skills; and Develops reflective thinking skills to evaluate and articulate their impact and personal development.   How can employers get involved in the UOWx initiative?There are a number of ways employers can get involved with the UOWx program:Become a mentorStudents who are participating in the UOWx Award Program who we have identified as being extraordinary. *Provide more info about opportunity and then link to the UOW Mentoring section* or email us at UOWx. Become a UOWx Seminar or Workshop PresenterUOWx runs 5 workshops a year which allow students to develop skills in a key employability/niche on trend area UOWx are always on the hunt for passionate and enthuastic presenters with industry experiences.

Moodle

This resource will provide an overview of Moodle. We will explain how to access Moodle, how to access course materials and how to upload assessments. 


What is Moodle?
Moodle is a learning management system that is used by the university to host course materials, to submit or complete assessments, and to participate in discussions.
When you study at the university, you will be able to access Moodle sites for each of your subjects and for some extracurricular activities. 
 
What do you use Moodle for?
You can use Moodle to access important documents (like subject outlines, assessment rubrics, lecture slides and recordings), to submit assessments, to complete assessments like quizzes, to check your grades for assessments and to participate in discussion forums. 


Accessing Moodle Moodle can be accessed via SOLS after you have logged in, by clicking on the ‘eLearning’ tab.  After you have clicked on the ‘eLearning’ tab, you will be navigated to your Moodle homepage (see image below). In the Site Summary section, you will find a list of sites, including those for each subject you are studying this semester. 


Using Moodle    Accessing course materials To access course materials, like lecture slides or subject outlines, locate them in the Moodle site by looking for links that appear in a blue font. Click on the link and the materials will either automatically download or open in a new tab for you. NOTE: Each subject coordinator can set up their subject’s Moodle site in a variety of formats, which means that course materials may appear anywhere in the site. If you can’t find them, contact your subject coordinator.      Uploading an assessment To upload an assignment to Moodle, locate the submission link in the subject’s Moodle site.. The link will appear next to a hand symbol.   		Click on the ‘Add submission’ button at the bottom of the page, and click on the ‘Add...’ button. Follow the prompts to select and add your assessment. When you have added your assessment, check the box that confirms the submission is your own work, and click on the blue ‘Save changes’ button. You will receive a digital receipt via UOWmail notifying you that your assessment has been submitted. This process may be slightly different on different Moodle sites. It is always best to give yourself some leeway with uploading assignments to ensure that if you experience any problems, you have plenty of time to seek help from your Subject Coordinator. NOTE: If you experience difficulty uploading your file, it may be that it is too big. An easy fix is to save it as a PDF and to submit the PDF version.    Using a discussion forum   A Moodle discussion forum is an online communication system the lecturer can organise for the students in the subject to collaborate and engage in discussion regarding set topics by the lecturer. As a user, you are able to read and post messages that can be seen by the whole cohort of students enrolled in the subject. If the lecturer has organised a discussion forum for the subject, the ‘dialogue’   symbol will appear under the subject name to inform you that there is a discussion forum for this subject to which you can contribute.   Closing date of Moodle subjects   Each subject you have enrolled in for the semester will have a closing date, after which you will no longer have access to the subject Moodle site. The closing date information can be located in your SOLS account under the tab Current Session > eLearning Details. This will display information such as the session, subject code and name, site name, and available from/to dates. To prevent disappointment when the subject is no longer in your ‘Site summary’ section in Moodle, it is best practice to save all the lecture notes and any additional information that may be relevant to you before the closing date.   The Moodle Student Dashboard The Moodle Student Dashboard will display feedback on your activity and results for a particular Moodle site. The dashboard will appear at the top of a Moodle page unless the Subject Coordinator has hidden it from view. Click on ‘Show progress’ to view the feedback. To learn more about the Moodle Student Dashboard, take a look at the ‘Moodle Student Dashboard – Information for Students’ page.

313,Assessment Feedback - Learning Co-Op @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/learningcoop/assessments/UOW244730.html,"


Understanding Assessment Feedback This resource explains feedback and overviews how to use feedback to improve your learning. 


What Is Feedback? Feedback refers to the constructive evaluation comments on an assessment task. Feedback is a powerful tool that can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses, direct your attention to areas that require improvement, improve your quality of learning, and develop interpersonal skills, such as communication and critical analysis. Types of feedback you may receive at UOW include:  Verbal feedback: Feedback is given verbally by teacher or peers       Written feedback: Feedback that is given in writing alongside with your marks after your teacher has evaluated your work. This may either be in the form of written comments or scaled on an assessment rubric.       Marks or grades: You will receive a mark for individual assessment tasks and an overall mark for each subject – this is a form of feedback too.    Where can I find my feedback?  When you receive marks for assessment tasks, you usually will receive written feedback. If it is a hard-copy assignment, generally your feedback will be written by hand by the marker throughout the document. They may also use the marking rubric to indicate how well you’ve performed in each area. If it is a digital assignment submitted through Moodle, your tutor or Subject Coordinator may upload a document containing your feedback, or a copy of your assignment with the feedback written at the end. If you can’t find your feedback, contact your Subject Coordinator or tutor. They may also choose to provide it verbally to you. 


Understanding and Using Feedback  To get the most out of feedback, you should:  Approach feedback with a positive mind. Receiving feedback can be hard, especially if you feel you haven’t done well. Try to remember that feedback is a tool for you to improve your learning.       Don’t just focus on the negatives. It can be easy to overlook positive feedback in favour for focusing on the negatives. Positive feedback is just as useful as negative, so make sure you use it to your advantage.       Critically reflect on the feedback you receive. Ask yourself if you agree with the feedback. Take a look at your assessment and try to understand what the marker is saying. How could you have done better? Did you prepare enough before the assessment? Where are your strengths and weaknesses? What did the marker identify that you did well?       Identify what you have done well, and what area(s) needed improvement. Think about how you can use it to improve for your next assessment task.       Ask for clarification from your Subject Coordinator or peers. If you aren’t sure what you need to improve on, or if you don’t agree with the feedback, talk to your tutor or Subject Coordinator. It may also be useful to reflect on your feedback with your peers.       Document the feedback you receive. Feedback is a way for you to improve in the future – you don’t want to forget it! Keep track of the feedback you receive in a word document that you can return to when completing your next assessment task.       


Giving Feedback While at university, you will be asked formally (i.e., as a part of an assessment task) or informally (i.e., by your peers or friends) to give feedback on others’ works. Giving effective and constructive feedback can be challenging and sometimes uncomfortable. Our Peer-Assessment and Self-Evaluation resource outlines useful ways to frame and deliver feedback to your peers.",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"
314,Effective Headings - Learning Co-Op @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/learningcoop/assessments/effectiveheadings/index.html,"


Effective Headings

This resource will introduce the use of headings in academic writing, including how to use headings correctly and what value they add to your writing.


What are headings?

Headings are signposts that help you structure longer pieces of writing and allow the reader easily navigate their way around a document. The type of headings used will depend on the format of your writing: for example, a case study will have different headings to a report. Make sure that:


	the heading system is clear and logical
	the sub-headings all have the same font style at that particular level
	the wording of the headings and sub-headings is alike.


It is best to take a couple of minutes to work out a plan for your headings before you start.



Components of an effective heading
Graded levels
It is common for headings to be graded at levels to communicate a logical structure. Usually it is advisable to use a maximum of three levels, depending on the length of the document. Don’t forget that the aim of using headings is to make it easy for the reader to easily find their way around a written document – using too many headings and levels can create confusion.
Levels are created with the use of font type, font size, position, capital letters, boldface and underlining. You can follow a given pattern or make up your own system so long as it is consistent.
Example
Level 1: CAPITALS, bold, 14pt, centered, space below

Level 2: Lowercase, bold, 12pt, left justified, space below

Level 3: Lowercase, italics, 12pt, left justified, no space below
 
The headings used in this resource are a good example of levelling without the use of numbers; however, in longer documents such as reports or theses, numbering is extremely important to assist the reader in keeping track of what section of the document they are reading.
 
Information distributed into logical sections
Headings should be used to identify a section; they are not to be used for each paragraph. Your analysis of the question will be key to working out your sections and headings.
Example
Question: what are the competitive drivers involved in a differentiation strategy?
1. COMPETITIVE DRIVERS 
         	1.1 Differentiation strategy and current operations
         	Definition of a differentiation strategy
         	Describe the difference of the theory in the previous heading to what is happening in your industry/business
         	1.2. New strategies
         	Provide the marker with what your group deems a profitable strategy
         	1.3. Justification
         	Provide reasons for this new strategy and offer evidence of your decision
 
Linked with the text
You should try to introduce the topic of your heading in the first paragraph following your heading. This will announce to the reader what will be coming up in that section. Remember that a heading does not speak for itself: the text following a heading should always restate and reinforce the main idea of that section, as in the example below.
Example

Reward and recognition of teaching
    The reward and recognition of teaching has been a national focus in Australian higher education since…

 
Grammar
Headings are usually single words or short phrases without a full stop. The wording, style and punctuation need to be consistent when designing a heading system, especially the use of capital letters. This can be achieved by following these three rules:

ensure all headings are brief
ensure the wording of the heading is specific to the text that follows
follow a parallel structure (editex 2016)

Example
To follow a parallel structure, you need to follow a grammatically consistent pattern for each heading level throughout the document.




Using ‘ing’ phrasing for headings
Using noun phrases for headings




Defining teaching standards
Determining criteria
Proposing a framework




Definitions of teaching standards
Criteria for judging teaching standards
Proposal for a framework






 
EXAMPLE
With capitalization, you have a choice of maximal or minimal capitalization.

With maximal capitalization, all words except articles, prepositions and conjunctions are capitalised.
              Eg. Rivalry among Existing Firms

With minimal capitalization, only the first word of the title and any proper nouns are capitalised.
              Eg. Rivalry among existing firms



When using headings do not:

	use too many headings
	change the style of headings within a document
	number the headings unless asked, e.g. numbering is likely to be needed in a long report but not a short document
	leave a heading at the bottom of the page by itself
	stack headings (no text between them)
	write headings more than one line long
	use definite articles to begin headings (e.g. âA Function of Business Xâ should be âFunction of Business Xâ)

Cover Sheets This resource describes cover sheets and explains the process of locating one for your assessment. 


What Is A Cover Sheet? A cover sheet is a document that contains metadata about your assessment, such as the assessment title, your name and student number, your tutor’s name, and other relevant data. Cover sheets are used to ensure your assessment goes to the right place to be marked, and that the right mark is assigned to you. If you are submitting a hardcopy assessment, you will be required to attach a cover sheet to your assessment before handing it in.   Do I use a PDF cover sheet or a barcode cover sheet? Which cover sheet you are required to use will vary between subjects. Check with your subject coordinator if you are unsure.


Finding The Correct Cover Sheet For Your Assessment   From the Current Students page, click on the Cover Sheets button. Click on your faculty from the list provided.   Follow the directions on your faculty cover sheets page.  Print out your cover sheet and attach it to the front of your assessment before dropping it off.   ",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"

318,Turn It In - Learning Co-Op @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/learningcoop/software/turnitin/index.html,"


TurnitinThese resources will provide an overview of Turnitin, It explains how to access Turnitin, how to submit assessments using the software, and how to understand an original report. 


What is Turnitin?Turnitin is an electronic text matching software used by the university to prevent plagiarism.How does Turnitin work?The software compares students’ assessments against a database containing copies of academic publications, assessments submitted by other students, and a slew of Internet content, and produces an originality report that indicates how much of the assessment has been plagiarised.What do you use Turnitin for?When you submit an assessment via Moodle, you may be required to do so through Turnitin. If your subject coordinator has set up the appropriate permissions, you are able to retrieve the originality report for your assessment to check that you have referenced appropriately. In some cases, you can then resubmit your work after improving any errors. 


Submitting your assessment through Turnitin
If you are required to submit your assessment via Turnitin, the Turnitin icon    will appear next to the assessment title.
To submit your assessment, click on the Submit Paper button. In the window that appears, upload your assessment file by clicking on the Add File  button and following the prompts. When you have uploaded your file, type the title of your assessment in the box provided, and click the ‘Add Submission’ button .
Upon uploading your assignment, you will receive a digital receipt to acknowledge that your assignment has successfully been uploaded to Turnitin. Take note of your ‘Turnitin submission id:’ in case you need to refer back to it in the future.


What is an Originality Report?The original report identifies how similar your assessment is to existing works and provides information about the sources that it matches.What can I use the originality report for?You can use your originality report as a guide to help you improve your assignment and academic writing skills. The report provides an overall matching similarity percentage and feedback about your work in terms of: Content: correctly acknowledging someone else’s ideas and writing Punctuation: correct use of punctuation to identify direct quotes that have been properly cited Quality of references: inclusion of recognised authors and well cited papers Format of references: presented in the correct format with all details 


Retrieving an Originality ReportThe first time that you upload your assignment, it will take 10 minutes for Turnitin to generate an originality report. To retrieve the report, click on the assessment link on your subject’s Moodle site, and then click on the similarity score next to your assessment (see image below). 


Navigating an Originality Report
Your original report will open in Turnitin’s document viewer. On the right-hand side, you will see the toolbar pictured below.







Active layers button. When viewing your originality report, you can choose to view it with two layers – grading and similarity. The grading layer will only be available after your assessment has been marked.






Instructor Feedback button. You can use this button to access feedback from your marker.






Match overview button. The number displayed here is your similarity percentage. When you click on this number, the Match Overview will be display. 
All sources button. Clicking on this will show a detailed report on each match, including the source of the matching text Turnitin has identified. 
Filter button. You can use this button to filter the report to exclude quotes, bibliographies, or sources that are a particular length or percentage.







Download button. Click on this button to download a copy of your originality report. 
Submission information button. Clicking on this button will display details on your submission, including the submission ID, submission date and file name.




 


Using Originality Reports      The similarity percentage The similarity percentage indicates how much of your paper matched to similar works. There is no “magic number” percentage that you should aim for. Generally the lower the percentage, the better. A high similarity percentage may be caused by incorrect referencing (i.e., incorrect punctuation in citations) or by text that is too similar to other’s works. To reduce your similarity percentage, double check you’ve applied the appropriate referencing style and try to summarise  or paraphrase your sources. If you are unsure if your percentage is too low or too high, contact your subject coordinator.   Identifying matches When you open your originality report, a match overview will appear. This displays a list of sources that Turnitin thinks may be too similar to your work. When you click on a match in the match overview panel, the software will jump you to the part of your submission that is related to the match, as well as displaying a pop up of the text Turnitin has found in its database that has similarities (see image below).     Resubmitting your assessment In most cases, you are able to resubmit your assessment after viewing the originality report. After correcting any errors, simply resubmit your assessment the same way you did the first time. NOTE: Turnitin will take 24 hours to generate new original report for any resubmissions.    Accessing assessment grades and feedback To view your assessment grades and any feedback provided by the marker, click on the Instructor feedback button. The marker may have also left comments throughout your assessment. To view these comments, ensure the ‘Feedback’ layer is selected using the Active Layers button. You can then scroll through the assessment document to find the comments. Click on the comment icons  to view the comments.   Downloading and printing your originality report  Before printing your originality report, ensure the similarity layer is selected as active by clicking on the Active layers icon  in the main toolbar and checking the box next to ‘Similarity’. Then, click on the Download icon  . This will download the entire document. Your similarity report will appear in the last pages of the document. Print the document as normal through the PDF viewer.

SummarisingThis resource will help you recognise the importance of summarising and describe how summarising habits relate to smart studying, ethical conduct and effective communication. 


What is summarising?To summarise is simply to identify the most important information from a text. You are probably summarising every day without thinking about it. A summary is always much shorter than the original text, but there is more to summarising than simply copying some sentences from a source and leaving out others. Summarising is a matter of analysing and re-purposing information.What is to be taken in summary from a text depends on the type of text being summarised and the new purpose to which information is to be put. An argument, for example, would be summarised into a thesis statement and a few key points, leaving out all the explanation and detailed evidence. A research report would be summarised into the motivating problem or driving question, the type of method and the findings of greatest significance, leaving out all the descriptive and explanatory details and raw data (exactly what an abstract does for a journal article). A summary of a case in law would comprise of something like the facts of the case, the decision, the ratio and any significant obiter, including noting dissenting judgements. If you’re not sure on the best way to summarise a type of text that you come across regularly in a subject, try asking your lecturer or tutor for clarification.The introduction to every academic text you read (and write) should provide the reader with a summarising preview of what is to come, rather than discussing the details immediately.Why summarise?Writing a summary is useful because in the act of identifying what is important, you are analysing and evaluating information, and forming memories of what you have read or heard – which is half the job of studying for an exam. Having an accurate and short record of what you’ve read or heard is also a useful source of ‘digested’ information for use when you need to generate a new text that involves re-presenting others’ ideas.


How do I summarise? You can summarise a text in many different ways, depending on which idea or concept from the original text you want to use for your own purposes. In the summaries below, there are several things to notice:   The original text can be shortened a little or a lot. A summary could be a simple selection of key sentences without changing them, but to be most useful as a learning strategy, summarising usually involves identifying the key words of the original text.  The topic of the message can be changed by starting with a different element. Conciseness can be achieved by choosing words that in themselves summarise larger chunks of information.  You still need to reference where you have used another person’s ideas, even if you have summarised it rather than copied it verbatim.  Example Original text (from Spiro 2013) “One of the considerations that is all too often ignored in discussions of tax policy is the way it affects the underground economy. Theoretical tax models almost always assume that everybody follows the rules. In reality, the behavioural response to tax changes has a wider range of variation than the choice between labour and leisure. Many otherwise honest citizens are prepared to break the law in order to evade taxes. Once the underground economy is taken into account – in effect, the proposition that individuals may decide to “opt out” of the tax system – there is a whole new layer of complexity to tax policy. Taxes that may seem to be optimal without the underground economy may no longer be optimal once it is taken into consideration.” Example summaries   Theoretical tax models should not overlook the effect of the underground economy on tax policy. As responses to tax changes vary between individuals, many are ready to commit tax crimes when faced with such changes (Spiro 2013).  Even honest citizens are prepared to evade taxes when faced with changes in tax policy (Spiro 2013).

320,Paraphrasing - Learning Co-Op @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/learningcoop/referencingciting/paraphrasing/index.html,"


ParaphrasingThis resource introduces paraphrasing as a critical academic practice and provides examples to help you recognise what makes a good and bad paraphrase.


What is a paraphrase? To paraphrase is to ‘reword’ text, so that the information stays the same while other aspects of the communication are changed. From a learning perspective, paraphrasing is really the nuts and bolts of information 'processing', done as part of taking notes or drafting new text. It is the opposite of mindlessly copying information, and plays a central role in developing a personal understanding of something, as well as in avoiding plagiarism. Plagiarism is not only about failing to acknowledge a source of information; it is also about failing to make sense of information in relation to a new purpose and context.Being able to paraphrase well is a challenging and creative part of academic writing. Doing it well demonstrates: you have a sound understanding of the original source you have credibility as an independent intellect you are proficient and flexible in your use of English   In contrast to a summary, which would be far shorter than the original text, a paraphrase might be of the same length, or even longer. What defines a good paraphrase is not its length, but the degree to which the original text has been reworded and referenced effectively and appropriately to accurately convey the original meaning and source in the context of the paraphraser’s argument. Why is paraphrasing difficult? Paraphrasing is often much more difficult than summarising, as paraphrasing requires you to reword the original text while retaining the meaning and relating the information in the context of your writing.If you don't paraphrase well, you might risk altering the meaning of the original text. Example Original text (from Jagtenberg & D’Alton’s Four Dimensional Social Space): The education system has performed, on an even wider scale, a major task of social control, training the growing workforce in the discipline and work style necessary in a capitalist economy, and systematically conveying ‘acceptable’ — i.e. safe — social attitudes to the rising generations.  Note that in this paraphrase the use of ‘the major form of control’ overstates and therefore misrepresents the argument in the original text. According to Jagtenberg and D'Alton (1988), the education system is the major form of control in a capitalist economy.  Also, if your paraphrase is too close to the original, it is considered plagiarised. Example Note that this paraphrase closely follows the structure of the original text and includes many of its phrases, and thus, can be considered plagiarism. According to Jagtenberg and D'Alton (1988), the education system has performed social control in a capitalist society:  training the growing workforce and work style, and teaching 'acceptable' social attitudes  for the young generations.  


How do I paraphrase? While there are a number of techniques you can use to put something into your own words, such as changing the sentence structure and noun phrases and using appropriate synonyms, the most important thing you need to focus on are the key ideas that you wish to convey to support your argument.You can paraphrase a text in many different ways, depending on which idea or concept from the original text you want to use to support your argument. In the examples below, the underlined part is the main idea of each paraphrase. Original (from Spiro's Tax Policy and the Underground Economy) One of the considerations that is all too often ignored in discussions of tax policy is the way it affects the underground economy. Theoretical tax models almost always assume that everybody follows the rules. In reality, the behavioural response to tax changes has a wider range of variation than the choice between labour and leisure. Many otherwise honest citizens are prepared to break the law in order to evade taxes. Once the underground economy is taken into account – in effect, the proposition that individuals may decide to “opt out” of the tax system – there is a whole new layer of complexity to tax policy. Taxes that may seem to be optimal without the underground economy may no longer be optimal once it is taken into consideration.   Examples Note in these examples, the key message to be conveyed from the original text is captured in the opening sentence or phrase. The underground economy is heavily influenced by tax policy. This is, however, often neglected by theoretical tax models, who usually assume that everyone follows the rule. In fact, as responses to tax changes vary, many honest citizens are prepared to commit tax crime (Spiro, 2013).  According to Spiro (2013), even honest citizens are likely to break the law to evade taxes when faced with changes in tax policy, as responses to tax changes vary between individuals. Despite this, many theoretical tax models often neglect the importance of the effect of tax policy change over the economy.  Spiro, in Tax Policy and the Underground Economy (2013), argues that theoretical tax models are wrong to overlook the effect that tax policy has on the underground economy because they unrealistically assume that every taxpayer follows the rules. In fact, different people respond differently to tax changes, and many may even commit tax crime when faced with such a problem.

My eQuals - digital academic documents UOW is working towards making digital academic documents available to students in the second half of 2018 through My eQuals, a secure third party provider of certified digital academic documents. Through My eQuals, UOW will digitally issue:TranscriptsTestamursAustralian Higher Education Graduation Statements (AHEGS), andUOWx Awards and UOWx Records (where relevant).My eQuals provides a number of benefits for users, including:-   A secure platform for universities to host and authenticate official digital academic documents, Anytime, anywhere access for students to their digitally issued documents, Once issued, students can share their certified digital documents with nominated third parties, and  Third parties can use the platform for education verification, via online access to an official document (once it has been shared by a student)  Having access to digital academic documents stored on a secure platform avoids the need for students to hold multiple original or certified copies of their academic documents, ultimately saving time, paper and money.    


When will digital academic documents be available?From December 2018, onshore graduating students will receive their official academic documents digitally, via My eQuals. For specific information about graduation and receiving your official digital and hardcopy documents, visit the Graduation website.Current (and past) students will also be able to request digital documents later in 2018, via the Official UOW Documentation webpage. A communication will be sent out when this service becomes available.

Global Communicators Program


Did you know that the students at UOW represent over 140 of the world’s countries? Global Communicators is a fun and informal way to meet other students, to have interesting conversations in English, to share your culture and to build international friendships and networks.
Each Global Communicators Program (GCP) session is coordinated by two students who are passionate about the importance of forming intercultural friendships, building cultural literacy and being global citizens. Read more about the leaders here.   





GCP is a community of UOW students who are passionate about being global citizens. By participating in interesting and engaging conversations (in English), you will get an opportunity to learn about different cultures and connect with people from around the world in a relaxed, friendly environment. GCP is also a great way to complement your studies at UOW, by enhancing your understanding of other cultures – a vital skillset in a global workforce. If you are an International Student and are wanting to attend workshops that are specific to enhancing your academic language skills please visit Learning Development. If you would also like to connect with the local community or attend seminars about Australian Culture, please visit Illawarra Friends of International Students (IFIS) and UOW Student Life. GCP, together with these and many other services/ experiences at UOW can contribute to making your time as a UOW student memorable.


This is a SAF funded program. Read more information about SAF here.

326,Call for Associate Editor - Journal of Peer Learning - PASS @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/services/pass/UOW246876.html,"


Call for Associate Editor - Journal of Peer LearningThe Journal of Peer Learning is an open-access, annual refereed journal established in 2008.  The Journal of Peer Learning disseminates scholarly work relating to peer learning across a variety of contexts, with an emphasis upon the use of peer learning in higher education.  More specifically, the Journal seeks to publish scholarly research that investigates innovations in peer learning including the implementation of programs in varied organisational and cultural contexts and evaluations of such programs that provide an evidential basis for the peer learning activities.The Journal is currently accepting nominations (including self-nominations) for the role of Associate Editor. Associate Editors serve a three-year term (July 2018 – June 2021) and can anticipate being asked to case manage approximately six manuscripts per year for the duration of their term.  This involves performing an initial review of manuscripts to evaluate their fit with the aims and scope of the Journal, sending appropriate manuscripts out for double-blind review, and then working with the Editor to make a final disposition/decision regarding each paper.Associate Editors should hold advanced degrees (Ph.D. or equivalent preferred); have a minimum of five years’ experience in higher education; be affiliated with an accredited college or university; and have expertise in quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods research design and analysis. Further, Associate Editors should commit to sending manuscripts out for review within two weeks of receipt.  Finally, Associate Editors should understand the importance of their dual role of gatekeeper and shaper of research in the field of peer learning and facilitate a rigorous review of manuscripts submitted for publication while also offering constructive and encouraging feedback to mentor fellow researchers.Individuals who meet these qualifications are invited to submit the following information to Dr. Bryce Bunting, Editor, at bryce_bunting@byu.eduLetter of intent including a list of specific scholarly interests related to peer learning(e.g., peer learning in the first-year experience, peer learning in academic contexts, peer learning in student affairs) and interest in reviewing studies employing qualitative, quantitative, and/or mixed methodsCurrent curriculum vitaeThe deadline for receipt of completed nomination packages is July 31, 2018. ",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"

328,Costs - Student exchange & study overseas @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/exchange/costs/index.html,"


Costs of studying overseas The following are costs that you will need to budget for when preparing for your overseas study:  UOW Exchange Program Fee ($150): This administration fee is payable after your acceptance to the UOW International Student Exchange Program. Please note this fee does not apply for short courses. UOW Fees (tuition fees): As an Exchange Student, you will continue to pay your tuition fees to UOW, rather than to your host university. This makes exchange a more affordable way to study overseas. You will be billed for 24 credit points in the faculty that 'owns' your UOW degree. Australian students may choose to defer part or all of their tuition fees via HECS. International Students must pay the full tuition fee direct to UOW by census date.  Passport (approx. $240): If you do not already have an Australian passport, or need to renew an existing one, visit www.passports.gov.au for application and fee information.  Visa Fees (varies by destination):  In most cases you will need to obtain a student visa for your host country and a tourist visa for any other countries you may be travelling to. Visa fees can be verified by contacting the Embassy or Consulate of the relevant country. All visa enquiries should be directed to the relevant Embassy or Consulate.  Insurance* ($0 for first 365 days):  All students are automatically covered by UOW's comprehensive travel insurance policy for the first 365 days of their overseas study.  Flight (varies): Contact your travel agent or search online to obtain a quote. Make sure you have been accepted before you book your flights. Living Expenses (varies):  All living expenses associated with overseas study are your responsibility. These costs and accommodation costs can be found on your host university website or may be communicated to you once you have made applied to the host university ^. Returned students are also a great resource for this kind of information. Some costs may include:   Accommodation Food Textbooks Transport Entertainment   UOW Faculty-Led Overseas Program: Several UOW subjects involve a compulsory overseas component – often a study tour where the whole class travels overseas together. In these cases, students enrol directly in a UOW subject, pay subject fees directly to UOW, and are guided through the short course application process by their UOW subject coordinator/s. Enquiries about these programs and subjects should be directed to the relevant Faculty International Office.   * You may be required to purchase health insurance (beyond the travel insurance that UOW provides) through your host university for the duration of your exchange. Your host university will advise you if this is required.  ^ Some host universities may charge additional costs to cover the student services offered there.  ",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"

FAQ's


Where can I study? Depending on your discipline and major, you can go on exchange to one of our overseas campuses or teaching partners. The University of Wollongong offers degrees in a number of countries including the United Arab Emirates (Dubai), Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia.What UOW degrees are taught overseas?The most up-to-date listing of UOW degrees taught at each partner institution can be found by visiting:UOWD, Dubai CoursesUOW College-Hong Kong, Hong Kong Courses     INTI, Malaysia Courses SIM, Singapore Courses PSB Academy, Singapore CoursesIs it difficult to have subjects approved in advance to study in a UOW program overseas? No, because you will be taking UOW subjects in these locations. You can simply go to the subject database and see which sessions your subject is offered at the relevant overseas campus. Note that some campuses offer programs on a trimester basis rather than a semester basis.The advantage for students in their second, third or later years of study is that you can take subjects which may be hard to match at other universities overseas.You will still need to complete a credit for prior learning exchange program form.How does it work?It works like exchange at any other university overseas.You require a credit average to participate, you need to go through the exchange application process and are eligible for travel grants.You continue to pay HECS charges for the subjects you study at the same rate you would if you were taking these in Australia.On your transcript the session will be shown as the campus session in which you studied. However, unlike other exchange, you will also receive a WAM for the subjects you took at the relevant campus.Why would I want to go overseas and study UOW subjects?Some students assume that the experience of studying at a UOW campus overseas is too much like staying at home.In fact, your experience at an overseas campus will be as different as if you had chosen an international partner university – without the hassle of getting equivalent subjects approved.You will be studying in a vibrant international city, highly ethnically diverse, in terms of the students in the program as well as in the host city.You will have access to extra-curricular experiences which are different to those available at UOW in Australia – especially the close industry and business links with our overseas partners.You will also have access to support services and campus facilities at each partner institution. ",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"

Enquiries about these programs and subjects should be directed to the relevant Faculty.     Faculty of Business:      Gary Noble - email Sean Lu at sean_lu@uow.edu.au  Faculty of EIS:      Christian Ritz at office-eis-international@uow.edu.au  Faculty of SOC:      Wilma Vialle at social-sciences-international@uow.edu.au  Faculty of SMAH:      Di Jolley at smah-international@uow.edu.au  Faculty of LHA:      Kate Bowles at lha-international@uow.edu.au   ",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"

Students with disabilities have the same rights and responsibilities as other students. It is not the disability itself, but the effect the disability has on a student's ability to access and participate in education which is relevant.This website is designed as a resource for both staff and students of UOW.


VIDEO: The 'Journey of Joe' This video highlights some of the issues that might be faced by a student with disability who wants to participate fully in university life. It was created by CATS - an Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) funded project that aims to assist universities in meeting the requirements of students with a disability.

465,Weighted Average Mark calculations (WAM) - Student Central @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/central/wam/index.html,"


WAM (weighted average mark) calculations Want to keep track of your eligibility to graduate with distinction or enter a Law School Honours program? We can help you with the WAM calculator at the bottom of this page. There are a number of different WAM calculations for different purposes. The below WAM calculator is based upon the calculation used to assess eligibility to graduate with distinction or apply for law school honours. Other calculations may be used and assessed by your faculty for other purposes.Before you get started, make sure you read the important information below…


Graduating with distinction   Eligibility criteria for the award with distinction is set out in the General Course Rules under ‘Eligibility for award with distinction’ section A final WAM of 75 or more will mean you are eligible to graduate with distinction, provided you meet all other relevant eligibility criteria (see eligibility summary below) WAMs are not rounded up. So for example, a WAM of 74.6 will not be eligible to graduate with distinction This calculator should be used as a guide only. Final assessment of your distinction WAM will occur when you apply to graduate, at which time your record will be assessed in line with the criteria defined in the General Course Rules   Eligibility summary  Pass Bachelor or Masters by coursework degrees are eligible for graduation with distinction Students in undergraduate degrees must have completed at least 50% of their degree in a UOW accredited course Students in postgraduate degrees must have completed at least 75% of their degree in a UOW accredited course Double degrees are assessed for distinction under each degree separately If 50% or more of your subjects are graded with satisfactory/unsatisfactory, the degree will not be eligible All subjects attempted at UOW in your course will be counted towards your WAM (some exceptions apply). Any subject completed in another course at UOW, which has been transferred into your current course as approved credit will also count towards your WAM (some exceptions apply). Grades associated with credit for subjects completed at other institutions DO NOT count towards your UOW WAM, and should not be entered into the calculator Fail grades DO count towards your WAM, and should be entered into the calculator (includes technical fail (TF) to be entered as 49) 


Law school honours Please read the information regarding eligibility and assessment on the law honours programs webpage.  


Calculation The calculation used in the calculator below is as follows:   Sum of (subject credit * mark) / sum of (subject credit)  Eg:  ACCY101 - 65 - 6 credit points MGMT203 - 82 - 6 credit points ECON313 - 76 - 8 credit points  (65 * 6) + (82 * 6) + (76 * 8) / (6 + 6 + 8) =  390 + 420 + 680 / 20 =  1490 / 20 = 74.5

Tertiary Literacies Over the time of your study at the University of Wollongong you will be helped to develop a set of knowledge and skills that can be defined as tertiary literacy. Tertiary literacy comprises of the five literacies listed below:  academic literacy – the skills of reading, critical analysis, writing and presenting orally are essential for students to be able to progress and demonstrate their ability across the subjects they are studying. Learning Development provides resources and programs to assist students who wish to improve skills in this literacy; information literacy - the capacity to recognise when information is needed and the capacity to locate, evaluate, and effectively use required information. StartSmart - Essential Academic Information Skills aims to help students by providing the knowledge on how best to locate the information required to support their university studies; computer literacy - the ability to effectively use computer devices and associated peripherals and generic software to find, store, retrieve and manipulate data. Information Technology provides computer and network services to students, including access to SOLS for the management of enrolment and personal details. statistical literacy - the ability to think statistically and to effectively use formal statistical reasoning. Three modules are available on-line to help students acquire core statistical literacy skills.  professional practices - the transfer and application of knowledge, values, attitudes and skills gained from university study to work and life settings including the management of a professional career. Careers Central can assist students to develop skills and experiences that assist with the transition from study to work.  Each of these literacies contribute to building your knowledge and skills to assist you to develop the qualities of a University of Wollongong Graduate.",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"

What is sexual assault and sexual harassment? Sexual assault is a crime, that can happen to anyone, of any age, gender, cultural background or sexual orientation. Sexual assault occurs when a person is forced, coerced or tricked into sexual acts against their will or without their consent, or if a child or young person under 18 is exposed to sexual activities. Sexual harassment is any unwanted, unwelcome or uninvited behaviour of a sexual nature which a person should expect will make the recipient feel humiliated, intimidated or offended. Sexual harassment can take many different forms and may include physical contact, verbal comments, jokes, propositions, the display of offensive material or other behaviour which creates a sexually hostile working or studying environment. Sexual harassment is not behaviour which is based on mutual attraction, friendship and respect. Sexual assault or sexual harassment can happen to anyone in our community. Female, male and LGBTIQ+ community members can be victims of sexual assault or harassment and are treated equally under the law. What is informed consent? To give informed consent you need to have an understanding of what is happening. A person who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol or who is asleep is unable to give consent. A person who is unable to understand what they are consenting to due to their age or intellectual capacity is unable to give consent. Additionally, consent needs to be free of any type of coercion, for example threats, intimidation or harassment.

What is SOLS and SOLSMail?SOLS is a vital student tool used by the University to manage student enrolment information. It is essential that students access SOLS regularly to ensure they don't miss out on important information.    Students should not skip University messages as they will risk missing vital information that may affect their enrolment, including penalties and fines.SOLSMail (or SOLS Messages), is one of the main tools the University uses to communicate important updates to students (e.g changes to a subject or an upcoming deadline). The University sends 'SOLSMail' notifications which students should 'read' and 'acknowledge'.Some helpful hints re SOLSMail are:Messages that are less than seven (7) days old will appear in a table at the bottom of the SOLS home page (most recent messages are at the bottom). Messages that are older than seven (7) days will pop up when students log into SOLS.  Students must read and acknowledge messages before they can continue to the SOLS main menu. Messages read (or were forced to read via a pop up) will appear in the SOLSMail History ViewAccessing SOLSFrom the Current Students page, find the SOLS login box (below):Type in your username and password; and Click LoginSOLS security It is important students keep their access SOLS safe and secure.  Please remember: It is a student's responsibility to keep their password and usernames secure to protect against un-authorised access of SOLS UOW staff will never ask students for SOLS passwords.  To protect from phishing attacks, students should not provide their SOLS password unless they are logging into SOLS via the Current Students pageIf using a shared or public computer, always log out after use SOLS will automatically log out after 60 minutes of inactivity (for security); and  The barcode on a student card can provide alternative access to SOLS (keep this secure and private).. ",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"

PlagiarismThis document provides information about the concept of plagiarism and ways in which it can be avoided.For information about the use of 'Turnitin' software (for text matching online and detecting plagiarism), please refer to your subject lecturer who is using the system for instructions in how to use it.1. PlagiarismWhat is plagiarism?Is plagiarism limited to words and ideas?Why should I acknowledge the work of others?What are the penalties for plagiarism?How can I avoid plagiarism?What is the policy for plagiarism at Wollongong University?Where can I get further assistance with academic literacy and conventions? i. What is plagiarism?Simply put, plagiarism is using the ideas, words, images or any form of representation made by someone else (authors, critics, journalists, academics, artists, lecturers, tutors, other students, and so on) without giving them proper acknowledgement. It is presenting the words and/or ideas of others as though they were your own - whether or not that information is plagiarised intentionally or unintentionally.You always need toprovide a reference whenever you include information from other sources in your work, andbe aware of the academic conventions concerning referencing. ii. Is plagiarism limited to words and ideas?Plagiarism is not limited to words and ideas; it also includes materials such as video and audio recordings, art and graphics, photographs, maps, diagrams, graphs and tables, computer programs or codes, research, and so on. This material can come from published sources, including books, journals, websites, films, newspapers and journals as well as unpublished sources such as lecture and tutorial notes and work by students.UNLESS IT IS CONSIDERED GENERAL KNOWLEDGE, ALL MATERIAL THAT YOU USE IN YOUR WORK THAT COMES FROM SOMEONE ELSE MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED.   iii. Why should I acknowledge the work of others?There are two main reasons why you should acknowledge the sources of your information:By not acknowledging the sources, you are in effect stealing (i.e. plagiarising).By acknowledging the sources correctly and effectively, you are strengthening your own work. a. Not Acknowledging SourcesPlagiarism is, in essence, an issue of intellectual property. If someone else has spent a great deal of time researching a topic, for example, then it is only right for that person to be credited for this work. Not acknowledging the intellectual property of others in your own work is the academic equivalent of stealing. The University of Wollongong’s policy on acknowledging sources of information states that if a student fails to properly acknowledge the sources used in her/his work, this is:unfair to the author;unfair to other students who do their own work without copying;failure to do independent work as expected in a university; andbreach of copyright.(http://www.uow.edu.au/about/policy/UOW058648.html) b. Acknowledging SourcesGenerally speaking, academic sources – statistics, facts, expert opinions, examples – strengthen your work by showing it is not only your personal opinion, but is also a well-informed and well-supported view. This is not to say that by including a lot of research into your work you will automatically create an academic text. To effectively use sources in your work, there are academic conventions that you need to learn, like when to use direct and indirect quotations and how to integrate evidence into your writing, just to name a few. These conventions are discussed in part v, How can I avoid plagiarism? iv. What are the penalties for plagiarism?The penalties for plagiarism can be severe and can range from a zero grade for an assignment or subject to expulsion from a subject and from the university. For this reason, you need to learn how to avoid plagiarism. v. How can I avoid plagiarism?Avoiding plagiarism is made easier by developing an awareness of academic writing skills and conventions. Some of these include:Efficient and effective note-taking and note-making strategies;An understanding of the difference between direct and indirect quotations;An understanding of the difference between summarising and paraphrasing;An understanding of how to integrate evidence from sources into your writing; andAn understanding of referencing conventions.Short explanations of these conventions and skills are provided below. It should be noted, however, that this information is highly condensed and is only meant to create a general awareness. The skills required to avoid plagiarism and to effectively integrate sources into your work are quite detailed. For this reason, links to pages within the University of Wollongong’s UniLearning website (http://unilearning.uow.edu.au) have been included to provide more detailed explanations and interactive activities. Finally, you should also refer to the guidelines for referencing within your faculty, as there can be minor variations across the university. a. Note-taking/ Note-making StrategiesEffective note-taking and note-making strategies will help you to keep records of exactly where you have found your information. There is nothing worse than finding information and integrating it into your work only to find that you can’t remember where you found it. Remember, if you can’t reference the information, you can’t use it. An effective and efficient method of note-taking is the Cornell Method as it separates notes into themes, notes, and responses, in the process helping you to develop a critical response as you read.To learn more about the Cornell Method of note-taking, go tohttp://unilearning.uow.edu.au/notetake/note12_cornell.html b. Direct and Indirect QuotationsAn indirect quotation is when you use the ideas of the author but use your own words. An indirect quotation must be referenced as the ideas are not yours. An indirect quotation can either be a summary or a paraphrase of the original and should not change the meaning by removing or adding essential information. The difference between a summary and a paraphrase is explained in part c.A direct quotation is when you use the exact words of the author in your work. Of course, a direct quotation must be referenced. There are specific conventions for using direct quotations in your work; for instance, direct quotations should be used far less frequently than indirect quotations. Also, a direct quotation should be enclosed by quotation marks, unless it is longer than a few lines, in which case it should be indented. These are just two of many conventions relating to the use of direct quotations.To learn more about using indirect and direct quotations, go tohttp://unilearning.uow.edu.au/notetake/note20_quotes.html c. Summarising and ParaphrasingA summary and a paraphrase are both indirect quotations; that is, they both encapsulate the ideas of an author but are expressed in your own words. There are two types of summary: an outline summary and a main point summary. An outline summary reduces a piece of text to at least a third the length of the original, whereas a main point summary is a sentence or two that states the main idea of a text or piece of text.To learn more about summarising, go tohttp://unilearning.uow.edu.au/notetake/note17_sum.htmlA paraphrase is usually about the same length as the original piece of text but is written in your own words. You need to be aware of acceptable levels of paraphrasing. Changing words and/or the grammar is often not sufficient. A paraphrase must be in your own words, and, as with a summary, you must not alter the meaning of the original.To learn more about paraphrasing, go tohttp://unilearning.uow.edu.au/notetake/note16_para.html d. Integrating Evidence into your writingWhen using evidence in your writing, it must be integrated in such a way that it supports your argument; evidence should not be presented as a substitute for establishing your own argument. A common mistake is to present a lot of information that is not integrated in such a way that it supports an argument. In such cases, the marker is left wondering how the information directly answers the question.To learn more about integrating quotes/evidence into your writing, go tohttp://unilearning.uow.edu.au/academic/4b.html e. Referencing ConventionsWhy reference? At university it is necessary to acknowledge the sources of information and ideas that you have incorporated into your assignments. Failure to do this thoroughly may result in accusations of plagiarism. While some students may view plagiarism as a relatively harmless offence, university departments take it very seriously.Referencing is not only about acknowledging other people’s work: accurate referencing and lists of references are beneficial as they allow readers to follow up information and read further into the area. This aspect of referencing will become more valuable to you as you progress in your studies.When to referenceYou should include a reference when you have incorporated an idea or concept into your work which is not your own (although you don’t need to include a reference when the idea or concept is common knowledge in your discipline). A reference is required regardless of whether those ideas or concepts are quoted in an author’s words, or whether they are rephrased in your own words (paraphrasing or summarising).How to reference: referencing systemsThere are two main referencing systems: in-text referencing (otherwise known as the author-date or Harvard System of referencing) and the notation system of referencing. These differ in i) the format of the references, and ii) in the location of the references. In-text referencing incorporates information on the author of the material cited and the date of publication within the body of the text, whereas the notation system places this information either at the bottom of the page (footnotes), or at the end of the text (endnotes). One disadvantage of in-text referencing is that the references may interrupt the flow of the text. Footnotes and endnotes, on the other hand, also pose a problem because they require the reader to look outside the body of the text for the reference.A comparison of the different types of referencing systems can be viewed athttp://unilearning.uow.edu.au/academic/4ciii.htmlDifferent faculties and departments have their preferred referencing system. If no guidelines regarding referencing are given in your subject outline or Faculty handbook, the best thing to do is to check with your lecturer or tutor. vi.

 The Respect. Now. Always. campaign was instigated by Universities Australia in collaboration with the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) to increase awareness of the issue of sexual assault and sexual harassment at Australian universities. Launched in February 2016, the campaign focuses on the determination of Australia’s universities to prevent and address sexual assault and harassment across the sector. The campaign is key in raising awareness of the issue of sexual assault and sexual harassment and increase visibility of student support services. The campaign places a spotlight on student and staff wellbeing, and highlights the support avenues available to prevent and manage incidents. In late 2016, tens of thousands of Australian university students, including the students of the University of Wollongong (UOW), were invited to participate in a prevalence survey surrounding student experiences of sexual assault and harassment. On August 1, 2017, the AHRC released a National Report containing the survey results. UOW committed to publicly releasing its institutional survey data in conjunction with the National Report. Read UOW's media release and associated institutional survey results. Further information about the definition of sexual assault and harassment is available on the Australian Human Rights Commission website.

What is sexual assault or sexual harassment?

What is sexual assault?
Sexual assault is a crime, that can happen to anyone, of any age, gender, cultural background or sexual orientation. Sexual assault occurs when a person is forced, coerced or tricked into sexual acts against their will or without their consent, or if a child or young person under 18 is exposed to sexual activities.
What is sexual harassment?
Sexual harassment is any unwanted, unwelcome or uninvited behaviour of a sexual nature which a person should expect will make the recipient feel humiliated, intimidated or offended. Sexual harassment can take many different forms and may include physical contact, verbal comments, jokes, propositions, the display of offensive material or other behaviour which creates a sexually hostile working or studying environment. Sexual harassment is not behaviour which is based on mutual attraction, friendship and respect. Sexual assault or sexual harassment can happen to anyone in our community. Female, male and LGBTIQ+ community members can be victims of sexual assault or harassment and are treated equally under the law.
What is informed consent?
To give informed consent you need to have an understanding of what is happening. A person who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol or who is asleep is unable to give consent. A person who is unable to understand what they are consenting to due to their age or intellectual capacity is unable to give consent. Additionally, consent needs to be free of any type of coercion, for example threats, intimidation or harassment.

480,Offshore students - Online enrolment frequently asked questions - Offshore students @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/offshore/UOW225771.html,"


Online enrolment frequently asked questions (Offshore students) At UOW we're here to make your enrolment as easy as possible so we've compiled a list of common issues students encounter when completing their enrolment through our online system. Enrolment help information for offshore students:  Personal details tab: please check carefully that all personal details are correct. Visa type does not apply to offshore students.  Survey tab: is a requirement of the Australian government that informs institutional decision making and reporting. Students are encouraged to complete this survey at the time of enrolment, however, may update later in SOLS.  Photo tab: you do not need to upload a photo, so you can skip this step. Your photo will be taken by partner staff on enrolment day. HELP Loan/SA Loan tab: you will notice that this tab has already been ticked. You do not need to do anything here and can skip the tab.  Any questions: please speak with an onsite staff member if you have any questions about the enrolment process.    General information covered on this page?  General enrolment issues  Login  User account  Personal details  Survey  Photo upload  Selecting an offer  Subject and course enrolment  Summary   


General enrolment issues    Enrolment Jargon Buster At UOW you'll hear a lot of jargon, so we've compiled a list of some of the more common terminology you will encounter: SOLS: Our online student administration system. You'll be using SOLS a lot while you are at UOW. Find out more about SOLS. UOWmail: Your unique UOW email account. Not only is this account for life, but best of all it entitles you to up to 5 downloads of the entire Microsoft Office suite. Find out more about UOWmail. Moodle: Our online learning platform. You can access this through SOLS.   When should I enrol? Please visit the following link for details about partner orientation and enrolment dates.    Why do some screens have a tick? Each time you complete a screen you'll see a little tick appear in the navigation panel, a little warning sign will show you that you still have things to do. Make sure all the screens have a tick before moving on!   Are all the screens compulsory? Aside from the photo upload, you will need to complete all of the screens in the enrolment system before you are officially enrolled as a UOW student.   How do I know that I've completed my enrolment? Your enrolment will be complete once you have emailed yourself your enrolment summary on the final screen.   I've completed my enrolment but want to log back into the system, what do I do? Once you have emailed your enrolment summary to your email address, you won't be able to log back into the enrolment system. Don't worry though; you can make a variety of changes (including changing your subject enrolment or billing type) through SOLS.   I've enrolled, what do I do now? After you've enrolled in your course and subjects, you'll need to also enrol in your classes (tutorials, practicals and/or seminars).  You'll need to attend your Orientation Session. Orientation is a chance for you to get important information about your faculty and your course of study. To find out more about orientation, including when you should come to a session, please visit the following link for details about partner orientation and enrolment dates.    Back to top  Login    How do I login for the first time? The first time you login, you’ll need to use your UOW Student ID and date of birth. Your UOW Student ID will have been sent to you in your enrolment emails.   I’m having problems accessing the system, what do I do? There are a couple of things that can prevent you from accessing the enrolment system. Check the following are all correct:  Make sure you are using the student number that was sent to you in your enrolment email. Check that your date of birth or other details you entered are correct.  If these are all correct, speak to the onsite staff who will be able to assist you.  Conditional Offers: If you have a conditional offer, you won’t be able to access the system until the condition is cleared. Speak with an onsite staff member who will be able to help you.    What do I do if I’ve forgotten my username and password? If you have already created your user account through the online system, you’ll be able to reset your password or recover your username online.    Back to top  User account    What is my username used for? Your username will be used to access all of our systems at UOW, so make sure that you keep your username and password confidential.   Can I change my username? Unless there are significant and compelling grounds, you won’t be able to change your username.   Why do I need to enter recovery information? Recovery information will help you reset your password should you forget it. Make sure you enter an email address which you will have personal access to during university (not an agent or your school email address).    Back to top  Personal details    What do I do if my details are incorrect? If your details are incorrect speak with an onsite staff member who will be able to advise you how to change these details.    My visa details aren't showing up on the personal details screen - is this a problem? Our enrolment system will not always display your visa information so don’t worry if it is showing ‘Not Applicable’.   Do I have to provide an emergency contact, and if so, who should they be? It is important that you provide the University with someone to contact in the unlikely case that something happens to you while on campus. Your emergency contact can be anyone who you trust to respond to a situation. Common emergency contacts include family or friends.   What is the difference between Current Session and Permanent Home Address? You have to provide the University with two addresses, the one where you will be living during semester (current session address) and your home address, so we can contact you out of session or when your course finishes. Don’t worry if the two addresses are the same, you’ll be able to copy them across at the click of a button! If your details change at any time, you’ll be able to update your address through SOLS.    Back to top  Survey    What is the survey and why do I have to do it? The enrolment survey is an Australian government mandated questionnaire that informs institutional decision making and reporting. It is important that you answer questions honestly, as your responses will contribute to planning for support services.   What happens if I don’t know the answer to some of the questions? Don’t worry - you’ll be able to update answers later in SOLS.    Back to top  Photo upload    Do I have to upload a photo? You may skip through this screen as your photo will be taken by partner staff on or prior to, enrolment day. This will be used for your UOW student ID card.    Back to top  Selecting an offer    I have multiple offers, what do I do? Select the offer for the degree that you want to enrol in. This will automatically update our enrolment system which will show you as having activated your enrolment for this offer.   I’m unable to select an offer, what do I do? Most of the time, the enrolment system will explain why you cannot select your offer. One of the most common reasons for this is that you have an offer for future session dates.  Other common reasons that you won’t be able to select your offer include: having a condition that needs to be cleared or outstanding fees against your offer (international students only). Speak with onsite staff who will be able to advise on how to fix this.     What do I do if I don’t have any offers?  If you don’t have any offers, speak with the onsite staff member for assistance.    Back to top    Subject and course enrolment    What if I have an offer for more than one course? You may have a choice of more than one course. If you change your mind after you’ve finished your enrolment, you will need to withdraw from your existing course and return to this screen and enrol into another course. It is your responsibility to withdraw from the original course to ensure you don’t incur a debt for those subjects.     When can I enrol in my subjects? The date you can select your offer (and enrol in your subjects) will vary due to different session dates at partner institutions. Please visit the following link for details about partner orientation and enrolment dates.   Do I have to select a major?  Some courses will allow you to select a major as part of your enrolment. You can change this through SOLS at a later date. Some courses don’t allow you to select a major, so don’t worry if you’re unable to change it at this time.   What subjects do I have to enrol in? You can find out what subject you need to enrol in by looking at your Student Handbook or by speaking with a staff member. Adding subjects will make you liable for fees and charges.   I’m having problems entering my subject codes, what do I do? Double check the subject code is correct, making sure that there isn’t a space between the letters and numbers. If you are still having problems, speak with the onsite staff member for assistance.    Back to top  Summary    What does this screen show? The summary screen is the final screen in the enrolment system. It is a record of all the data which you have entered to date. If there are any mistakes, you should change it before sending your enrolment summary to your email.   Do I have to email myself the summary and what email will it go to? Yes, you do have to email the summary to yourself as this will act to finalise your enrolment. This will be emailed to the recovery email which you entered on the personal detail page. Once you have done this you will be locked out of the enrolment system and any changes will need to be made through the SOLS.    Back to top

Timetable FAQ'sWhen you have successfully enrolled into subjects for your degree, the next step is to enrol in tutorials (which are actual class times). If this is your first session at UOW, you may wish to view the Timetable and Tutorial enrolment video to walk you through the enrolment process. For all other enquiries, please refer to the following FAQ's, or contact Student Service for assistance.   When do tutorials openOpening dates and times vary for each Faculty and subject.  Be sure to check your Faculty opening times in advance.  When they have been opened by the Faculty, tutorials can be selected through SOLS via the 'Tutorial Enrolment' link. My “preferred” tutorial is full If your preferred class or tutorial is full, you may need to choose a different option.  However, if you have extenuating circumstances such as work, family commitments, or clashes with another class, you will need to refer to your Faculty (or Department) instructions  for assistance. All tutorial classes for my subject are fullIf all tutorials are full, you will need to contact you will need to refer to your Faculty (or Department) instructions for assistance.  My tutorial class clashes with another class or lectureIf there are no available classes to choose from you will need to contact your Faculty (or Department) contact who may be able to add you to the lass, or assist with a tutorial swap. What does EDU STREAM mean?Some Lecturers record lectures live (or remotely) and upload them on to the Moodle Platform for students to watch via SOLS.  Your Lecturer will discuss this (and attendance requirements) in the first lecture (or will detail the information in the subject outline). Which classes are compulsory?Refer to your subject outline (generally provided via Moodle). What is a Workshop/Practical/Computer Lab?Different subjects have different types of activity requirements.  Student timetables (for subjects) will specify what is required for each subject.  Lecturers will generally discuss expectations, and advise of specific attendance requirements (during the first lecture or detailed in the subject outline). What happens if I cannot attend a class?If you cannot attend a class you will need to notify your lecturer or tutor as soon as possible.  They will advise you on what steps to take (dependent on the subject requirements).   My tutorial has week 2, 4, 6, 8. What does this mean?This means that the tutorial is not held every week, i.e., only on the specified weeks of session (week 1 is the first week of session).   What are the greyed out boxes? Do I need to select a class for these?Anything that appears 'greyed out' is a lecture from a subject timetable.   However, you cannot enrol in grey items in tutorial enrolment pages.  Lectures that you 'have' to enrol in will be colour coded accordingly.  For assistance, contact your Faculty (or Department) contact for assistance. I am enrolled in a subject but the subject codes don't appear (in my tutorial enrolment) for me to choose a classIf you click on your tutorial enrolment and the subject does not appear, this may be because the classes have not been set up, i.e., it is too early.  Another reason could be that you may be allocated classes by staff.  If you are unsure and would like assistance, contact your Faculty (or Department) for assistance.   Why can’t I click on my class to select a time?Ensure you have familiarised yourself with the relevant colour coding for tutorial enrolment.  Ask yourself if it is before the first day to enrol , or is after the last day to enrol.  Remember you cannot enrol until the tutorial date and time has opened.  When a tutorials has closed, you will be unable to select a class.  For assistance, contact your Faculty (or Department)  to add you into a class (if the last date to enrol into a class has passed).  ",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"

492,Student Complaints - Current students @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/complaints/UOW008298.html,"




Complaints The University aims to treat any concern or complaint seriously, and will seek a resolution as quickly as possible. What is a complaint? If you have experienced a problem with a UOW service, product, staff member or student, and you would like a formal investigation to commence, then you should let us know by submitting a formal complaint. This page will explain the process for you. If you have general feedback i.e. suggestions, praise, or a concern (and you are not requesting a formal investigation) feedback can be submitted via UOW's Feedback portal. Complaint resolution process 


Step 1 - resolve informally Self-managed stage – wherever possible, UOW encourages individuals to attempt to resolve the issue at the first level i.e., with the respective area/person, service, before lodging a formal complaint. If you are a student, you are encouraged to work through the matters of concern with the appropriate staff member (closest to the situation) as this is often the most effective way to resolve issues without further escalation. For e.g., most issues can be resolved informally through discussion with your faculty, Tutor, Lecturer, Course Advisor, Head of Students or the head of the relevant academic or administrative unit. 


Step 2 - Submit formal complaint University-managed stage – If you are dissatisfied with the outcome at the self-managed stage you are welcome to escalate your issue through the formal complaint process.      Academic Complaints If you have a complaint relating to your studies, for example, about a mark awarded for an assignment or exam, you should refer to the process outlined in the Student Academic Complaints Policies:              Coursework Academic Complaint Form [PDF 373kb] [docx 267kb]   HDR Academic Complaint Form [.docm 76kb] Coursework Academic Complaints Policy HDR Academic Complaints Policy    Non-Academic Complaints If you have a complaint relating to a non-academic matter, you can contact the Complaints Management Centre     


Step 3 - Appeal process External Avenues – If you have followed all internal complaint resolution processes, you are welcome to refer your matter to an external body. The NSW Ombudsman is one avenue you can use to make a complaint about administrative actions and decisions of the University. If you have not followed the University's internal grievance procedures, the Ombudsman may ask you to do so before accepting the complaint.

Research has shown that if you are:

an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander student
a student from a family with a low income
a student who speaks English as a second language
a student with a disability
a female student who is studying in a non-traditional area (e.g. engineering)
a student who cares for someone with a disability
a student from a rural or isolated area

starting at uni and successfully completing your studies can be a bit more difficult than for other students.
Student Support Advisers (SSAs) can give you information about the support available and programs that may make your time at uni a little more manageable. We also provide you with personal support and can refer your to any community services that may be of assistance.

Student Visa
Your student visa allows you to stay in Australia while you are studying. Australian immigration laws are very strict and if you do not comply with the conditions on your visa, you might have your visa cancelled and have to leave the country. If this happens you may not be able to return to Australia for another 3 years.
Your student visa should be valid at all times: if you allow it to lapse, you will have to leave the country and re-apply for a new visa to come to Australia. To avoid this you should apply on line with DIAC to renew your visa before it it due. Give yourself at lease 2 months before your visa is due to start applying. Don't leave it too late!
Visa information and student conditions are updated regularly so it is important to always check your information is correct and up-to-date. There are a number of ways to do this which are listed below:

Visit the International Student Website. Through the International Student Website you can access International Student Administration and Visa information.
    The International Student Website also provides information regarding the ESOS legislation and National Code and its implications for International Students. This site is updated regularly so be sure to have a look regularly.

Student Support Advisers (SSAs) are based in each of the faculties and provide a liaison, referral and support service to all students. If you have any concerns that are of a non-academic nature go and see your SSA. Follow the link to the contact details and the faculties for each of the SSA. They can also help you with more complex problems relating to your visa renewal or applications or any difficulties you are having with university processes.  If you need help go and see your SSA as soon as possible.      
        
DIAC. If you have any questions and are unsure of the correct process or information it is always a good idea to check directly with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. DIAC has a comprehensive student visa website which can be found at http://www.immi.gov.au/students/ and also run a number of different information telephone lines. For general enquiries and information call 131881.

Immigration Advice
In Australia, only certain people can provide migration advice to people who wish to enter or stay in Australia. Immigration laws are very complex and DIAC regulations change frequently. Under Australian law, only government registered Migration Agents may give immigration advice. If you do decide to see a migration agent you must check that they are registered with the Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA). Registered Agents are listed on the MARA website and a list of Migration Agents can be searched according to where you live.
Most Migration Agents do charge a fee, so it is advised you phone and make an appointment and ask what fee if any will be charged.
DIAC are also able to provide advice about different visas that are available and the conditions and requirements associated with these. Have a look at the DIAC website at www.immi.gov.au or call their general information line on 131 881.
The SSAs are not authorised to give immigration advice and are limited in the assistance they can legally provide. If you are requiring assistance go and see your faculty SSA who can direct you in the right direction. ",,"['time', 'wine', 'bomaderry', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'saturday', 'australian', 'yesterday', 'evening', 'faculty', 'solids', 'kangaroo', 'meaningful', 'flow', 'property', 'mechanical', 'conversation', 'english', 'visiting', 'high', 'bulk', 'multiple', 'tasting', 'group', 'groups', 'memories', 'engineering', 'moments', 'experiments', 'valley']"

508,Student Ombudsman - Support & wellbeing @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/services/so/index.html,"




Office of the Student Ombudsman The University of Wollongong is committed to the early and informal resolution of academic complaints. The Student Ombudsman represents a dedicated position that focuses on the independent review of coursework and higher degree research students’ academic complaints. The role of the Student Ombudsman adds value to the University by providing a specialist area that aims to ensure processes are implemented fairly and, where necessary, improved. The Office of the Student Ombudsman provides a place for impartial and confidential review of these matters.  As a student you can expect to be treated respectfully, to be given a fair hearing and to receive equitable treatment.    What is the Student Ombudsman's Role? The role of the Student Ombudsman is to independently review undergraduate, postgraduate and higher degree research (HDR) student academic complaints that have not been resolved informally or through the formal Faculty level process. The Student Ombudsman is also responsible for the independent review of student academic misconduct appeals; students may appeal against the finding of a Faculty Investigation Committee if the appeal is based on a lack of due process or if there is new and substantial evidence that has not previously been considered.  As Chair of the Coursework Exclusion Appeals Committee, the Student Ombudsman continues to oversee the Stage 2 Coursework Student Course Progress appeals process. The Student Ombudsman's Terms of Reference can be found here.  Who is the Student Ombudsman?  Associate Professor Margaret Wallace is the Student Ombudsman. Margaret has worked at UOW for over 20 years as a Sub Dean, a Course Coordinator and also as an Academic Developer.  She has led a number of projects including those on Assessment Moderation and the Development of a Course Coordinator (APD) Role Statement and been involved in educational research, including a national project on academic integrity.. She is committed to supporting the quality of the student learning experience by offering timely, fair and well-considered outcomes for student academic complaints that cannot be resolved at Faculty level.  More recently, Margaret has provided curriculum expertise in Learning, Teaching and Curriculum, a role which she will continue on a part-time basis.   What is an Academic Complaint? An academic complaint is a complaint concerning a decision, act or omission of a member of UOW staff or committee that affects a student's academic experience.  When CAN I Lodge an Academic Complaint with the Student Ombudsman? Coursework Student Academic Complaints - Stage 2 Review by Student Ombudsman You need to have lodged a formal academic complaint with your Faculty in the first instance and have completed Stage 1A and Stage 1B of the formal Faculty complaints process i.e. a review by the Head of School (Stage 1a) and a review by the Faculty Designate (Stage 1b).   If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint on the basis that:  you do not believe the outcome of Stage 1  is supported by the available evidence; due process has not been adhered to by the Faculty; or relevant new or additional information is now available that was not available at Stage 1A and 1B.  you may appeal to the Student Ombudsman within ten (10) working days of the date you receive the outcome of your Stage 1B review by the Faculty Designate.  For Higher Degree Research (HDR) Student Academic Complaints You must lodge a formal academic complaint with your Faculty in the first instance and complete Stage 1 of the formal Faculty complaints process.   If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint on the basis that:  you do not believe the outcome of Stage 1 of the process is supported by the available evidence; due process has not been adhered to by the Faculty; or relevant new or additional information is now available that was not available at Stage 1.  you may appeal to the Student Ombudsman within twenty (20) working days of the date you receive the outcome of your Stage 1 review by the Faculty Designate.  The Coursework Student Academic Complaints Policy, the Higher Degree Research (HDR) Student Academic Complaints Policy and Student Academic Complaints forms can be found here   What are the Possible Outcomes of an Appeal to the Student Ombudsman?  A number of outcomes are possible after all relevant documents have been examined and following interviews with the student and other relevant parties. The Student Ombudsman may determine that:  the matter will go no further if there are insufficient grounds for the complaint; or a basis for negotiation exists between the student and relevant parties; or due process has not been followed in which case a resolution involving the Faculty will be reached.  For Undergraduate or Postgraduate Coursework academic complaints, you will be notified of the Student Ombudsman's decision,  in writing, within twenty (20) working days and, where relevant, of the process for continuing your appeal. Higher Degree Research academic complaints can often be more complex and, consequently, the Student Ombudsman may take some time to thoroughly investigate a matter.  You will be regularly updated on the progress of your complaint, notified of the Student Ombudsman's decision in a judicious manner and, where relevant, of the process for continuing your appeal How Do I Lodge an Appeal with the student ombudsman? You can either email your completed complaint form and supporting documentation to the student-ombudsman@uow.edu.au, or you can hand deliver your documents to the Student Ombudsman's Office. Where Can I Find the Student Ombudsman? The Student Ombudsman's Office is located in Room 19.G003 (Building 19, Ground Floor, north-east wing).  Office hours are Monday to Friday 8.30am - 4.00pm.

Recharge




When you’re studying hard for an exam, often the first thing to go out the window is your sleep cycle. You stay up late, you wake up early… And even if you’re not spending all night studying, you’re spending all night thinking about studying, which is just as disruptive.
Recharge can help with that. The app helps track your sleep schedule, gives you some activities to do in the morning to get the blood pumping, allows you to track your mood, and – maybe best of all – comes with a super-loud, super-effective wake-up alarm.
Cost : Free




HabitBull




One of the hardest things to do when preparing for exams is getting into a good study routine. It’s just so easy to get distracted by the internet, friends, your phone or games.
Enter HabitBull. A motivational app, HabitBull allows you to track and input good habits, even giving you a score based on how well you’re keeping up with routines. It’s great for noticing patterns in your behavior, too: maybe there are specific days when you’re more alert than others, or maybe you tend to work better on the weekends rather than on week nights.

UOW Application for Refund of Fees - International form
General Information 
Student fee refunds for International students are administered under the UOW Fees Policy and the legislative guidelines of The Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000 and associated legislation. This is the legal framework governing the responsibility of education institutions for overseas students.
Once you have accepted an offer to UOW, your eligibility for a refund of fees paid to University of Wollongong is determined by whether you are a:

New student unable to commence study, or
Existing student who has completed at least 24 credit points of study, or
A student who is unable to study due to special circumstances.

This information page is intended to be a guide only. Assessments for Fee Refunds are made in accordance with the UOW Fees Policy.
Leaving the University 
Where International students are leaving the University, they must also ensure they have followed the correct procedures to be released or withdraw from their course before a fees refund application can be considered. For information on how to be released from the University please visit the Leaving the University web page 
IMPORTANT: Students should still complete and return an Application for Refund of Fees – International form available from the Student Forms web page, even if their release from the University is still pending. The request will be held until the release is approved.
Back to top
Refunds for new students 
A new student is a person commencing study at the University of Wollongong under a new offer. This includes packaged offers of 2 or more consecutive offers made for study at University of Wollongong. A refund request in this case would refer to the first session of fees paid in advance for your UOW offer. As per the UOW Fees Policy, UOW will assess refund applications based on the valid course offer.



Important Definitions

Commencement Date: The start date of the first session of new offer (As per valid offer letter and as published on the Session & Key Dates  web site.)

Census Date: Date by which enrolment and fee payments must be finalised. Each session of study has a census date and these are displayed on your SOLS record in addition to being published on the Session & Key Dates  web site.



Note: One full session of study may be made up of multiple intakes which equal 24 credit points. Where multiple intakes fall within the first full session of study, applications are assessed based on the first commencement and census date.

Back to top
What are Special Circumstances? 
Special circumstances are generally considered to be unusual, beyond the student’s control and were either not known before the commencement date for new students or census date for existing students, or significantly worsened after that date.
As per the UOW Fees Policy, you must be able to demonstrate with independent supporting documentation that your circumstances:

Were beyond your control – A situation that a reasonable person would consider is not due to your action or inaction, or which you were not responsible for. Please note that a lack of understanding or knowledge of university fees or census date deadlines is not considered to be beyond your control, AND
Did not occur, or their full impact was not known until after the commencement date for new students or census date for existing students – the circumstances occur before the commencement or census date, but worsen after that day, or before the commencement or census date, but the full effect or magnitude does not become apparent until after that date, AND
Because of the circumstances you were unable to complete your study requirements – You were unable to undertake the necessary private study required, attend sufficient lectures or tutorials, or meet other attendance requirements in order to meet your compulsory course requirements.

Special circumstances DO NOT include a lack of knowledge or understanding of census dates or the university’s enrolment and withdrawal processes. See the Examples of special circumstances and appropriate documents.
Back to top
What supporting documents are required? 
Each application is assessed primarily on the independent supporting documentation you provide to the university. Please note that a personal statement describing your special circumstances is not sufficient evidence to have your application approved. Personal statements of your special circumstances should be supported by documentation.
As per the UOW Fees Policy, supporting documentation needs to:

Be on official letterhead (if appropriate), signed and dated
Include medical provider number (if appropriate) and contact details of the person providing the document
Include all relevant dates and indicate the severity of your circumstances
Advise the date your circumstances first began
State whether your circumstances changed after census date and if so, the date they changed and to what degree
Comment on how your special circumstances affected your ability to meet study commitments
Advise when it became apparent that you could not continue your study

Depending on your special circumstances it may be appropriate to seek documentation from:

Your doctor
The Department of Immigration
Psychologist or counsellor
An independent member of the community (such as a Justice of the Peace or Minister of Religion)
Your Faculty

Back to top
Examples of special circumstances and appropriate documents 
Example 1 – MEDICAL
A medical condition became known after the commencement or census dates for study, OR a pre-existing medical condition deteriorated significantly after the commencement or census date and you were unable to continue your study.
Provide a letter from your doctor which states:

The date the medical condition began or changed
How the condition affected your ability to meet study requirements
When it became apparent that you could not continue your studies.

Example 2 – FAMILY/PERSONAL
Due to unforeseen personal or family reasons which occurred or worsened after the commencement or census date, you are unable to continue study. There are a wide range of circumstances which fall into this category such as:

A close family member has a serious illness after commencement or census date, and you are required to provide full-time care
A family member or close friend dies and you are affected to such a degree that, after the commencement or census date you realise you cannot continue study.

Provide a certified copy of death certificate, death notice etc, or a letter from your family doctor, counsellor or independent member of the community (such as a Justice of the Peace or Minister of Religion) which states:

The date your personal circumstances changed
How your circumstances affected your ability to meet study requirements
When it became apparent that you could not continue your studies.

Example 3 – COURSE RELATED REASONS
If your Faculty discontinues a subject after the commencement or census date and as a result you cannot complete the subject, or;
if you have failed to meet the University’s course progression rules and as a result are not permitted to re-enrol due to suspension and/or exclusion or;
you fail to meet the terms of your conditional offer letter.

Provide a letter from your Faculty which gives details of the circumstances affecting you.
Provide documentation to support your failure to meet course progression rules.
Provide documentation to support your failure to meet the terms of your conditional offer letter.

Back to top
What if I fail a subject? 
If you fail a subject(s), you will still be charged for the affected subject(s).
If you failed because of special circumstances which occurred after census date and were beyond your control, you may submit  an Application for Refund of Fees – International available from the Student Forms page.
You will need to provide evidence of your special circumstances with supporting documentation.
Back to top
What if I do not attend any classes? 
UOW encourages all students to manage their enrolments effectively online via the SOLS system. Therefore, regardless of whether you attend classes, if you do not ‘formally withdraw via SOLS’ before census date, you will still be charged for the enrolled subject(s).
In these instances, you should consider making an Application for Late Withdrawal Without Academic Penalty (available from the Student Forms page) if it is too late to withdraw yourself from your subjects online via SOLS.
Please be careful not to withdraw from subjects and affect your completion date which in turn, will affect your Confirmation of Enrolment at UOW (COE). More information about ‘Managing Your Course’ can be found on the International Students web page.
Back to top
I am not happy with the outcome of my refund application 
If the student believes that the University has not considered all of the relevant information or has not honoured the Fees Policy in making the decision, students can appeal in writing (email is not appropriate).
Address your written appeal to the ‘Senior Manager – Admissions, Fees and Scholarships’ and submit it to Student Central at the University of Wollongong via post or in person.
An application for a review of that decision must be made within 20 working days of receiving the original decision.
Grounds for consideration of an appeal include:

Lack of due process, or
Relevant new or additional information being available which may alter the outcome of the original decision.

       Employers One of the key drivers for UOWx is to help students increase their employability. In the process of creating UOWx, we sat down with over 25 employers from a range of industries and posed the question, ‘If everyone has a degree, how do you choose who gets the job?’ They all pointed to the skills and experience students had gained outside of the classroom. Each employer highlighted the importance of soft skills that are gained through work experience and volunteer opportunities.  When a student graduates from UOW they will have their co-curricular activities listed on their UOWx Record. Students who have made a significant contribution to their learning will graduate with the UOWx Award.  Want to get involved?Register your interest here!  Why choose UOWx graduates? UOWx graduates have met rigorous criteria around various learning streams, all of which were identified by employers as being necessary skills in today’s workplace. Each recognised co-curricular activity provides students with the opportunity to develop in a minimum number of skill areas, including:Improve a student's organisational skills;Contribute positively to learning of self or others;Develops effective communication and interpersonal skills; Demonstrates intercultural awareness; Develops a student's problem solving skills; and Develops reflective thinking skills to evaluate and articulate their impact and personal development.   How can employers get involved in the UOWx initiative?There are a number of ways employers can get involved with the UOWx program:Become a mentorStudents who are participating in the UOWx Award Program who we have identified as being extraordinary. *Provide more info about opportunity and then link to the UOW Mentoring section* or email us at UOWx. Become a UOWx Seminar or Workshop PresenterUOWx runs 5 workshops a year which allow students to develop skills in a key employability/niche on trend area UOWx are always on the hunt for passionate and enthuastic presenters with industry experiences.

541,Student complaints - Have your say @ UOW,https://www.uow.edu.au/student/haveyoursay/studentcomplaints/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=business,"




Complaints The University aims to treat any concern or complaint seriously, and will seek a resolution as quickly as possible. What is a complaint? If you have experienced a problem with a UOW service, product, staff member or student, and you would like a formal investigation to commence, then you should let us know by submitting a formal complaint. This page will explain the process for you. If you have general feedback i.e. suggestions, praise, or a concern (and you are not requesting a formal investigation) feedback can be submitted via UOW's Feedback portal. Complaint resolution process 


Step 1 - resolve informally Self-managed stage – wherever possible, UOW encourages individuals to attempt to resolve the issue at the first level i.e., with the respective area/person, service, before lodging a formal complaint. If you are a student, you are encouraged to work through the matters of concern with the appropriate staff member (closest to the situation) as this is often the most effective way to resolve issues without further escalation. For e.g., most issues can be resolved informally through discussion with your faculty, Tutor, Lecturer, Course Advisor, Head of Students or the head of the relevant academic or administrative unit. 


Step 2 - Submit formal complaint University-managed stage – If you are dissatisfied with the outcome at the self-managed stage you are welcome to escalate your issue through the formal complaint process.      Academic Complaints If you have a complaint relating to your studies, for example, about a mark awarded for an assignment or exam, you should refer to the process outlined in the Student Academic Complaints Policies:              Coursework Academic Complaint Form [PDF 373kb] [docx 267kb]   HDR Academic Complaint Form [.docm 76kb] Coursework Academic Complaints Policy HDR Academic Complaints Policy    Non-Academic Complaints If you have a complaint relating to a non-academic matter, you can contact the Complaints Management Centre     


Step 3 - Appeal process External Avenues – If you have followed all internal complaint resolution processes, you are welcome to refer your matter to an external body. The NSW Ombudsman is one avenue you can use to make a complaint about administrative actions and decisions of the University.

Online enrolment help At UOW we want to make your enrolment as easy as possible so we have compiled a list of frequently asked questions to help you complete your enrolment through the Online Enrolment system.  Important information  Personal details  Selecting an offer  Subject and Course enrolmentFeesSurveyUploading a photo  Summary 


Important information    I’m having problems accessing the system Don’t panic.  You may need to clarify one of the following categories below before you can start your enrolment: Student type on admissions does not match - we just need to confirm you are a Domestic student. To do so, please email a certified copy of your passport and/or birth certificated to sc-enrolment@uow.edu.au                  Not a valid offer/ conditional offer - if you have studied at another University, UOW will require a certified copy of your Academic transcript.  A scan of this document can be emailed to the Future Students team for verification.                  Don’t know your student number - if you applied to UOW directly, your student number will be referenced in your offer letter/email.  If you applied via the University Admissions Centre (UAC), your student number is sent to you via email (within a week or so after receiving your offer from UAC) to your preferred email account.  Please note, even if you receive multiple offers from UOW, your student number will stay the same.  If you are still unsure, you are more than welcome to contact the Future Students team on 1300 367 869.   How do I login for the first time? The first time you login you will need to use your student number and date of birth. Your student number is referenced in your offer letter/email.Please make sure you have this information ready before commencing your enrolment.   When should I enrol? It is recommended that you start the enrolment process as soon as possible after receiving your offer letter/email and/or your offer to enrol email. Students can start the enrolment process 60 days before any session commences.     Can I use my smart phone to enrol? Yes, our enrolment screens are mobile-friendly. However, the system has been optimised for tablets, laptops and desktops, so your experience will be more user-friendly if you use a device with a larger screen.   Why do some enrolment screens have a tick? Each time you complete a screen the system will display a tick on the navigation panel (top of screen). If you still have things to do, the system will display a warning sign.  With the exception of the photo upload screen, you will need to make sure that each screen has a tick as the system will not allow you to continue while a warning sign is displayed. If all screens have not been completed, you will not be considered to be enrolled as UOW student.   I've completed my enrolment process but I want to log back in.Once you receive your enrolment summary via email, you won’t be able to log back into the enrolment system.  The good news is that you can change any of the information (including subjects and billing type) through your SOLS account.  This will be activated approximately one hour after completing the enrolment process. NOTE: If you have received a subsequent offer at UOW, you can re-enter the system and enrol in your new course.   Why do I need to enter recovery information? Recovery information is very important, it is there for you if you need to reset your password (or other personal information) at any given time.  Make sure you enter an email address that you have personal access to during your time at UOW. NOTE:  This should NOT be an agent or high school email address.  An appropriate example is a @hotmail or @gmail email account.   Enrolment language help At UOW you will hear a lot of jargon.  The following are some of the more common enrolment terminologies that you will hear: SOLS: SOLS stands for Student Online Services, and is UOW's online student administration system. It is the main tool UOW uses to update students on important information (concerning courses etc.).  You will use SOLS a lot during your time at UOW so it is important to keep your SOLS information recorded.  Find out more about SOLS. UOWmail: UOWmail is your unique UOW email account.  Not only is this account for life, but it entitles you up to five downloads of the entire Microsoft Office suite.  More information about UOWMail can be found here. Moodle: is UOW's online learning platform.  Over the course of your study, a Subject Coordinator may set up a Moodle site for certain subjects.  You can access Moodle through your SOLS account.    Back to top  Personal details    What do I do if my personal details in the enrolment system are incorrect? If ANY of your details are incorrect it is important that you do NOT confirm your details. You should contact Student Central who can help you update the information.    My visa details aren't showing up on the personal details screen - is this a problem? Our enrolment system will not always display your visa information so don’t worry if you see ‘Not Applicable’ for your visa details.   Do I have to provide an emergency contact, and if so, who should they be? Yes. It is important that you provide UOW with someone to contact in the unlikely case that there is an emergency on campus. Your emergency contact can be anyone you trust to respond to a personal situation like a family member or close friend.    What is the difference between Current Session Address and Permanent Home Address? Upon enrolment you will have to provide UOW with two addresses: 1. One for where you will be living during each academic session (current session address); and              2. One for your home address where we can contact you out of session.               Don’t worry if the two addresses are the same, you’ll be able to copy them across at the click of a button.  If your details change at any time, you’ll be able to update your address through SOLS ‘personal details’.    Back to top  Selecting an offer    What do I do if I don’t have any offers? If you can't see any offers, you will need to contact the Future Students team for assistance.    I have multiple offers, what do I do? Firstly, you will need to select the offer for the degree that you want to enrol in.When you have done this, the enrolment system will automatically update, displaying that you as having an activated enrolment for that offer.   I’ve been given an offer through UOW’s Early Admission Program, but I want to accept my main round offer?  You will be able access the enrolment system even if you have previously completed the enrolment process for your early admission offer.  To do this:Log in to the UOW enrolment system, and select your new offerWithdraw from your previous subjects; andEnrol in your new subjects.    Back to top  Subject and course enrolment    Why do I have default subjects? Some courses have core subjects that you must complete. The enrolment system will pre-populate the information for you, all you have to do is click the ‘Add’ button, it’s that simple.   What subjects do I have to enrol in? To find the subjects required to enrol in will be detailed in the First Year Enrolment Guide for your course, or the Course Handbook (relevant to your continued studies). If you're enrolling in a postgraduate course, you should refer to the UOW Postgraduate Course Handbook.   NOTE:  For 100, 200, 300 and 400 level subjects, please refer to first, second, third and fourth year subjects respectively.  Normally in your first year at University, you will only need to enrol in 100-level subjects, for e.g., ACCY111.   How many subjects am I supposed to enrol in? Domestic undergraduate students have the option of enrolling in as many subjects as they like. To complete an undergraduate course within the time-frame, i.e., three (3) years, students should be enrolling in four (4) subjects per session.NOTE: If you are enrolled in less than three (3) subjects* you will be considered a part time student which can affect Government benefits.If you are enrolling in a postgraduate course, you may not need to enrol in as many subjects as an undergraduate student. Be sure to consult your course's entry in the UOW Postgraduate Course Handbook. *please note law students must be enrolled in four (4) subjects per session for their first year.     When I try and enrol it says ‘Course constraint’. What do I do? This probably means that you are trying to add a subject that doesn't correspond to your degree.  Remember to check the First Year Enrolment Guide (if you are a new student), or Course Handbook for returning students.  If you are still having issues, please contact the Future Students team for assistance.      I’m having problems entering my subject codes, what do I do? You will need to ensure the subject code you are trying to enter is correct.  For e.g., subject codes need to be seven digits, make sure there isn’t a space between the letters and numbers for codes with seven digits (ACCY111), and that there is a space for codes with six digits (LAW 111). If you are entering the number correctly and you are still experiencing issues, this could be due to:    The last date to add a subject has passed (refer to Key Dates)The subject quota is 'Full'There is a Course Constraint (see above); or You have reached the maximum points for enrolment into the session.  For assistance, please contact Student Central for assistance.    I have credit for prior (CPL) learning – what subjects can I enrol into? Before you can finalise your enrolment, you will need to liaise with your Faculty who can help you with appropriate subject selection.  Faculty office contacts are as follows: Business: business-enquiries@uow.edu.auEngineering and information Sciences: eis@uow.edu.auLaw, Humanities and the Arts: lha-enquiries@uow.edu.auScience Medicine and Health: Smah-student@uow.edu.auSocial Sciences: ssc@uow.edu.au     I only enrolled in one subject, where can I add the rest? If you completed the online enrolment process with only one subject, you CAN change/add/withdraw additional subjects through your SOLS account.  To do this: Log into SOLS; andSelect 'Enrolments / Variations' (from the left hand menu.   Do I have to enrol in the following session’s subjects all together? If you are not sure what subjects you will be taking in the following session, i.e. Spring after Autumn session, you are not required to enrol during that session.You have plenty of time to enrol before each session commences.   What if I have more than one course offer? If you have an offer for more than one course you will need to make sure you only have a completed enrolment for your course preference, i.e. if you change your mind after you have finished an enrolment, you will need to withdraw from the existing course and return to enrol in your chosen course. NOTE: It is the students responsibility to withdraw from courses you will NOT be studying before the Census date to ensure you do not incur a debt for those subjects.  If you do not know the Census date, you can check this on via the Key Dates page, or through your SOLS under the 'Enrolment and Variations' area.    How do I select a minor/major? Some courses allow you to select minors or majors as part of the enrolment process.  However, some courses do NOT.  Don’t worry if you are unable to change the information at the time of enrolment, you can always change it through SOLS at a later date.  For more information on minors/majors, visit the Majors and Minors information on the Manage Your Enrolment web pages.     Back to top  Fees    When are Fees due? Students will not incur fee liabilities until the relevant sessions Census date.  The Census date changes from session to session and is the last date to:Pay FeesWithdraw from subjects without paying for them; andThe last date to change HECS / HELP billing options (if eligible).   You can find our the relevant census date by checking the Key Dates page, or through the 'Enrolment and Variations' menu in SOLS (for that session).   Can I change my preferred payment option? Yes, you can change your payment option (billing) through SOLS.  Remember, this needs to be done before the relevant sessions Census date.  To do this: Log into SOLSOpen the Fees menu (select Help-Loan Option)Click on the 'Maintain' button for your default billing type; and Follow the prompts.  If you wish to defer your fees, you will need to provide your Tax File Number during these steps.  Please ensure you familiarise yourself with all the information provided before you agree and continue.  When agreed:Submit your new billing preference (ensure you double check your billing type and TFN details are correct).   NOTE: Remember this must be done before the relevant session Census date.   What are HECS-Help and SA Help? HECS-Help is an Australian Government Scheme that allows ‘eligible’ domestic students to defer their fees.  SA-Help is a loan which covers the compulsory Student Services and Amenities Fee. NOTE: HELP-Loans and SA-Help are only available to Australian Citizens or Permanent Humanitarian Visa Holders.  Whatever payment option you decide on, remember to finalise options and payments by the session Census date (which is the last date to withdraw without financial penalty (refer to Key Dates).  If you do NOT settle your payment option by the relevant Census date, you may be at risk of having your enrolment cancelled.   What if I don’t have a TFN yet – Can I still enrol? Yes, you can enrol in your course without a Tax File Number (TFN).  A TFN is only required if you are an eligible student using the HECS-HELP billing option. To progress your enrolment:You need to select ‘upfront’ as your billing option (for now as this does not ask for a TFN); andWill need to change it to HECS-HELP (through your SOLS account) after you have received your TFN. NOTE: Once you have received your TFN, remember to change your billing option to HECS-HELP through SOLS.  You will have only have until the Census date of the session you are enrolling in.   I’m paying upfront; do I have to read and understand all payment options? Yes, even if you are paying your fees upfront, you still need to read and acknowledge all forms on the SOLS ‘Help Loan Option’ tab.  This will ensure you have read and understood all payment options, and can select the ‘full upfront payment’ as your billing option at the end.   Where can I get more information about fees? UOW fees will depend on your student type.Please refer to the Fees and Assistance webpage outlining fees and charges students may incur while studying at UOW.    Back to top  Survey    What is the survey and why do I have to do it? The enrolment survey is an Australian Government mandated questionnaire that informs institutional decision making and reporting. It is really important that you answer questions honestly as your responses will contribute to planning for support services at UOW.   What if I don’t know the answer to some of the questions? If you do not know the answer, you can leave the question blank.    Back to top Photo upload    What will the photo be used for? The photo that you upload will be used for your UOW Student ID Card after the first year enrolment.  You will need to keep your Student ID with you at all times: Student ID's can be used as UOW Library cards (access printing, scanning and copying services)Student ID's identify students (especially during examination periods); andYou will need your Student ID to verify your identity on Campus.    Do I have to upload a photo? Uploading a photo will save you time when you go to collect your Student ID.  However, if you are unable to upload a photo, simply skip the step.  You can always get a photo taken by UOW Staff at a later date.   Are there requirements for the photo? Yes.  There are requirements for your photo to meet before it is accepted.  You can find a full list of requirements online. NOTE: The system will allow photos which do not meet the requirements, however, if your photo doesn’t meet our standards, a new photo will have to be taken which will result in some delays.   I don’t like my photo, can I change it? Yes, you can change your photo at any time before you finalise your enrolment on the system.  However, once you have received your email summary, your photo will be finalised in the system. If your Student ID is generated and you don't like the photo, you will need to order a replacement card from Student Central (ground floor, building 17).  This will incur a cost of $10.00.   My photo won’t upload, what do I do? Double check the file format.  UOW suggests converting the image into a JPEG or a PNG before attempting to upload the photo again. Remember, this step is not compulsory so you do not have to upload a photo to complete your enrolment.    Back to top  Summary    How will I know that I have completed my enrolment properly? Your enrolment will be complete once you have emailed yourself the enrolment summary.  This is done on the final enrolment screen.   What does this screen show? The summary screen is the final screen in the enrolment system.  It is a record of all the data you have entered.  If there are any mistakes, you should change it before sending your enrolment summary to your email.   Do I have to email myself the summary and what email will it go to? Yes, you do have to email the summary to yourself as this will act to finalise your enrolment.  This will be emailed to the recovery email which you entered on the personal details page.  Once you have done this you will be locked out of the enrolment system and as such, any changes will need to be made through the SOLS.

 The Respect. Now. Always. campaign was instigated by Universities Australia in collaboration with the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) to increase awareness of the issue of sexual assault and sexual harassment at Australian universities. Launched in February 2016, the campaign focuses on the determination of Australia’s universities to prevent and address sexual assault and harassment across the sector. The campaign is key in raising awareness of the issue of sexual assault and sexual harassment and increase visibility of student support services. The campaign places a spotlight on student and staff wellbeing, and highlights the support avenues available to prevent and manage incidents. In late 2016, tens of thousands of Australian university students, including the students of the University of Wollongong (UOW), were invited to participate in a prevalence survey surrounding student experiences of sexual assault and harassment. On August 1, 2017, the AHRC released a National Report containing the survey results. UOW committed to publicly releasing its institutional survey data in conjunction with the National Report. Read UOW's media release and associated institutional survey results. Further information about the definition of sexual assault and harassment is available on the Australian Human Rights Commission website.


Safe and Respectful Communities (SARC) Draft Action Plan The SARC Draft Action Plan is designed to inform and guide the activities the University of Wollongong will undertake to meet our responsibility to provide a Safe and Respectful community at the University of Wollongong and respond to the nine recommendations of the Australian Human Rights Commission's report 'Change The Course'. Read the Safe and Respectful Communities Draft Action Plan. Written submissions are invited by staff, students and interested stakeholders via sarca-uow@uow.edu.au. The Draft Action Plan is open for consultation until Friday 10 August 2018. Feedback on the Draft Action Plan is welcomed by filling out the SARC Draft Action Plan Feedback form.


Creating a safe work and study environment
UOW is fully supporting the aims of the Respect. Now. Always. campaign and is dedicated to a continuous process of raising awareness, providing support and ensuring the safety and wellbeing of its students and staff. UOW places the highest priority on providing a safe study, living and working environment. Sexual assault and sexual harassment matters are dealt with under a ‘support first’ model and individuals are encouraged to report any incident to UOW for investigation.
UOW offers a range of free programs for staff and students, including:


Expand / Collapse Mental Health First Aid (includes violence prevention and consent training)  UOW offers Mental Health First Aid - a course that empowers every trained student and member of staff to help a person who is developing a mental health problem, or who is in a mental health crisis, until appropriate professional treatment is received or the crisis resolves. UOW Mental Health First Aid workshops for students include content from the MATES (Prevention of Violence) and the Consent Matters online module. You can find information on upcoming events here.  Step Up Bystander Intervention  The UOW Wellbeing Program includes the Step Up Bystander Intervention course. This course is a prosocial behaviour and bystander intervention program that educates students to be proactive in helping others. Teaching people about the determinants of prosocial behaviour makes them more aware of why they sometimes don’t help. As a result they are more likely to help in the future. Please note that details about this course will be provided soon.  International Student Programs (ISP)  International Student Programs connect students with people from all over the world, offering opportunities to make new friends, develop skills and link to the local community. Key programs that specifically support students are the Transition to Australia workshops, and social English Conversation Groups that connect students with UOW and wider community members. Prosocial development programs help students establish resilient networks, develop positive behaviours and promote community and individual wellbeing.  Consent Matters  UOW has invested in the Epigeum Consent Matters course with the purpose of ensuring a respectful, safe and positive UOW Community. This online course will develop student and staff skills in understanding sexual consent, support and develop their thinking around personal boundaries and how to talk about them. The program also demonstrates different ways to be an effective bystander or respond to a situation that they feel is uncomfortable or requires further action. UOW Wellbeing will complement online modules with a blended learning peer-led experiential program to further develop an understanding of effective prevention of sexual assault, sexual harassment or sexual violence.  Responsibilities, Rights and Respect (RRR Module)  Responsibilities, Rights and Respect (RRR Module) – an online module for students that promotes respectful relationships on campus free from discrimination or harassment.  In Residence programs  In Residence programs - ask your Residential manager about Student Leader programs on violence prevention and programs on health and safety education, including sexual consent.  UOW Wellbeing  UOW Wellbeing promotes workshops through the student Life and Wellbeing Program.  EO On-line  EO On-line - an online module for staff that promotes respectful relationships on campus free from discrimination or harassment.  Fullstop Foundation's Leadership Training  Ethical leadership to prevent gender-based violence in universities Key leaders and managers at UOW, including Residential Managers, and Senior Academic and Professional staff, attend workshops covering the latest best-practice violence prevention research and leadership skills, policies, procedures and initiatives that promote respect and violence prevention. Our staff and peer leader training programs also include training on how to respond to a disclosure of sexual assault or sexual harassment. Our leadership and staff training programs are delivered by educators who have been specifically trained to deliver sexual violence prevention programs and include guest speakers from the local Violence Abuse & Neglect Service. 


UOW’s policies provide information on how it responds to and seeks to prevent incidents:
Sexual Harassment Prevention Policy sets out the University’s response model regarding sexual harassment for staff and students. It contains information regarding how to raise a complaint and seek help.
Close Personal Relationships Guidelines sets out expectations regarding staff obligations to appropriately manage staff-student relationships and relationships between staff members, acknowledging that these relationships can raise issues concerning the balance of power and conflicts of interests. Staff are strongly advised not to enter into close personal relationships with students. However, where they exist or develop, staff are required to disclose the relationship in accordance with the University’s Conflict of Interest Policy. Students are also strongly encouraged to disclose the relationship independently to their Head of School or other appropriate senior officer.
Safe and Respectful Communities Advisory Group
The University of Wollongong has recently established the UOW Safe and Respectful Communities Advisory Group (SARCA Group).
This new Advisory Group has been formed to provide advice directly to the Vice Chancellor to address the recommendations issued in the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) Report called Change the Course: National Report on Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment at Australian Universities, 2017. 
SARCA terms of reference (TOR) and membership provisions are available by clicking here. For enquiries email Sarca-uow@uow.edu.au. 
UOW has implemented a series of additional actions towards addressing the issue of sexual assault and sexual harassment.

What is sexual assault or sexual harassment?

What is sexual assault?
Sexual assault is a crime, that can happen to anyone, of any age, gender, cultural background or sexual orientation. Sexual assault occurs when a person is forced, coerced or tricked into sexual acts against their will or without their consent, or if a child or young person under 18 is exposed to sexual activities.
What is sexual harassment?
Sexual harassment is any unwanted, unwelcome or uninvited behaviour of a sexual nature which a person should expect will make the recipient feel humiliated, intimidated or offended. Sexual harassment can take many different forms and may include physical contact, verbal comments, jokes, propositions, the display of offensive material or other behaviour which creates a sexually hostile working or studying environment. Sexual harassment is not behaviour which is based on mutual attraction, friendship and respect. Sexual assault or sexual harassment can happen to anyone in our community. Female, male and LGBTIQ+ community members can be victims of sexual assault or harassment and are treated equally under the law.
What is informed consent?
To give informed consent you need to have an understanding of what is happening. A person who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol or who is asleep is unable to give consent. A person who is unable to understand what they are consenting to due to their age or intellectual capacity is unable to give consent. Additionally, consent needs to be free of any type of coercion, for example threats, intimidation or harassment.
